## Proper nouns

You may be wondering how to write proper nouns with Lapwing theory. So far, the drills have not included any proper nouns at all. This is because they can sometimes conflict with other words (for example, "mat", "math", "Mat", and "Matt").

Lapwing uses the number key to help get around this issue. Proper nouns are written exactly the same as regular words, with one exception: the first stroke includes the `#` key.

#### Examples

* `#A/TPHA` Anna
* `#KAL/TKPWAR/KWREU` Calgary
* `#PHAT` Mat
* `#SRAPB/KAOU/SRER/AOEU/HRAPBD` Vancouver Island

### Proper nouns starting with "j"

`#SKWR` is a really hard chord to press, especially when writing at speed. `#STKPW` is an alternative chord for proper nouns starting with "j".

* `#STKPWER/PHA/TPHEU` Germany
* `#STKPWO/TPHO/THAPB` Jonathan

## Alternative proper nouns with a prefix stroke

Some machines may not be compatible with remapping the top `S-` key. In this case, you can instead use `#` as a stroke on its own to prefix proper nouns. This is handled through the <code>lapwing-prefixed-proper-nouns.json</code> dictionary. If you do not need this functionality, you can safely remove this from your dictionary stack.

#### Examples

* `#/KEFPB` Kevin
* `#/PAT` Pat
