## Proper nouns

Proper nouns in Lapwing theory are written exactly the same as regular words, except with the addition of the number key in the first stroke. Proper nouns can be multiple words long, but only the first stroke has to contain the number key (see examples below). The inclusion of the number key reduces conflicts, such as between "mat" and "Mat".

#### Examples

* `#A/TPHA` Anna
* `#KAL/TKPWAR/KWREU` Calgary
* `#PHAT` Mat
* `#SRAPB/KAOU/SRER/AOEU/HRAPBD` Vancouver Island

### Proper nouns starting with "j"

`#SKWR` is a difficult chord to press, especially when writing at speed. `#STKPW` can be used as an alternative chord for proper nouns starting with "j".

* `#STKPWER/PHA/TPHEU` Germany
* `#STKPWO/TPHO/THAPB` Jonathan

## Alternative proper nouns with a prefix stroke

Some machines may not be compatible with remapping the top `S-` key. In this case, the number key can be used as a stroke on its own to indicate that subsequent strokes will be treated as a proper noun. This is handled through the <code class="code-mono">lapwing-prefixed-proper-nouns.json</code> dictionary. If you do not need this functionality, you can safely remove it from your stack.

#### Examples

* `#/A/TPHA` Anna
* `#/KAL/TKPWAR/KWREU` Calgary
* `#/PHAT` Mat
* `#/SRAPB/KAOU/SRER/AOEU/HRAPBD` Vancouver Island
