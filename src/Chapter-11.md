## Intro

All the chords covered so far represent single sounds. However, there are some chords (particularly on the right hand) that can represent multiple syllables. These are referred to as compound clusters.

## Right hand -shun, -kshun, and -x

* `-GS` is "-shun" as in "o<ins>cean</ins>"

<steno-outline stroke="-GS" width="100%" alt="-GS on the steno layout"></steno-outline>

* `-BGS` represents two sounds:
  - "-x" as in "ta<ins>x</ins>"
  - "-kshun" as in "fri<ins>ction</ins>"

<steno-outline stroke="-BGS" width="100%" alt="-BGS on the steno layout"></steno-outline>

### Examples
* motion `PHOEGS`
* caution `KAUGS`
* fax `TPABGS`
* tex `TEBGS`

### -kshun and -x conflicts
Some words like "a<ins>x</ins>e" and "a<ins>ction</ins>" conflict with the same outline: `ABGS`. In these cases, the "-x" sound is given higher priority and "-kshun" sound is relegated to `*BGS` (same chord, but with the asterisk key).

#### Examples

* faction `TPA*BGS` (since `TPABGS` is already "fax")
* section `S*EBGS` (since `SEBGS` is already "sex")

### Mnemonics:

1. "mu<ins>gs</ins> in the o<ins>cean</ins>"
2. `-BGS` as the "-x" chord is simply just the combination of the "-k" chord `-BG` and the `-S` key
3. `-BGS` as the "-kshun" chord overlaps with the "-k" chord `-BG` and the "-shun" chord `-GS`

## Right hand -ment and -let

* `-PLT` is "-ment" as in "mo<ins>ment</ins>"

<steno-outline stroke="-PLT" width="100%" alt="-PLT on the steno layout"></steno-outline>

* `-LT` is "-let" as in "scar<ins>let</ins>"

<steno-outline stroke="-LT" width="100%" alt="-LT on the steno layout"></steno-outline>

### Examples
* garment `TKPWARPLT`
* torment `TORPLT`
* roulette `RAOULT`
* wallet `WAULT`

### Mnemonics:

> Feel free to come up with your own or even suggest some!

1. Taking the middle out of "ment" gives "mt" which is what `-PLT` represents
2. Taking the middle out of "let" gives "lt" which is what `-LT` represents

### Section practice

Unfortunately, there is not a lot of practice material for single stroke words containing these chords.

## Right hand `-BL` and `-BLT`

* `-BL` represents the "-bl" sound as in "glo<ins>bal</ins>"
   - When this sound is preceded by a vowel, the `-BL` chord can be extended to represent the whole sound as in:
      - "pli<ins>able</ins>"
      - "poss<ins>ible</ins>"

<steno-outline stroke="-BL" width="100%" alt="-BL on the steno layout"></steno-outline>

* `-BLT` represents the "-bility" sound as in "sta<ins>bility</ins>"
   - When this sound is preceded by a vowel, the `-BLT` chord can be extended to represent the whole sound as in:
      - "cap<ins>ability</ins>"
      - "feas<ins>ibility</ins>"

<steno-outline stroke="-BLT" width="100%" alt="-BLT on the steno layout"></steno-outline>

### Examples

* rebel `REBL`
* playable `PHRAEUBL`
* terrible `TERBL`
* mobility `PHOEBLT`
* viability `SRAOEUBLT`

### Mnemonics:

> Feel free to come up with your own or even suggest some!

1. `-BL` already looks a lot like the sounds it represents, it just sometimes skips over an unemphasized vowel.
1. `-BLT` is just building off of `-BL` with a "i**t**y" sound.

## Right hand -shus and -shal

* `-RBS` is the "shus" sound as in "cau<ins>tious</ins>"

<steno-outline stroke="-RBS" width="100%" alt="-RBS on the steno layout"></steno-outline>

* `-RBL` is the "shal" sound as in "so<ins>cial</ins>"

<steno-outline stroke="-RBL" width="100%" alt="-RBL on the steno layout"></steno-outline>

### Examples

* nauseous `TPHAURBS`
* precious `PRERBS`
* facial `TPAEURBL`
* special `SPERBL`
