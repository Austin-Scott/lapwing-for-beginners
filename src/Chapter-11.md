# Chapter 11: Right hand compound clusters

## Recommended pace

**Recommended time to spend on this chapter: 2–5 days.**

1. Read [right hand shun and kshun](#right-hand-shun-kshun) and complete the drill (**20 minutes**)
   - Repeat the drill as needed
2. Read [right hand ment and let](#right-hand-ment-and-let) and complete the drill (**20 minutes**)
   - Repeat the drill as needed
3. Read [right hand bl](#right-hand-bl) and complete the drill (**20 minutes**)
   - Repeat the drill as needed
6. Attempt the [test](#chapter-10-test) (**20 minutes**)
   * Practise as needed

Remember to take breaks!

## Intro

So far, we have been looking at single sounds that make up single syllable words. In this chapter, we will look at **compound clusters** which are chords that can represent more than just a single consonant.

## Right hand shun, kshun, and x

* `-GS` is "-shun" as in "o<ins>cean</ins>"
* `-BGS` represents two sounds:
  - "-x" as in "ta<ins>x</ins>"
  - "-kshun" as in in "fri<ins>ction</ins>"

### Examples
* motion `PHOEGS`
* caution `KAUGS`
* fax `TPABGS`
* tex `TEBGS`

### "-kshun" and "-x" conflicts
Some words like "a<ins>x</ins>e" and "a<ins>ction</ins>" conflict with the same outline: `ABGS`. In these cases, we give the "-x" sound higher priority and relegate the "-kshun" sound to `*BGS` (same chord, but with the asterisk key).

#### Examples

* faction `TPA*BGS` (since `TPABGS` is already "fax")
* section `S*EBGS` (since `SEBGS` is already "sex")

### Mnemonics:

1. "mu<ins>gs</ins> in the o<ins>cean</ins>"
2. `-BGS` as the "-x" chord is simply just the combination of the "-k" chord `-BG` and the `-S` key
3. `-BGS` as the "-kshun" chord overlaps with the "-k" chord `-BG` and the "-shun" chord `-GS`

## Right hand ment and let

* `-PLT` is "-ment" as in "mo<ins>ment</ins>"
* `-LT` is "-let" as in "scar<ins>let</ins>"

![ment, let](img/11-ment-let.png)

### Examples
* garment `TKPWARPLT`
* torment `TORPLT`
* roulette `RAOULT`
* wallet `WAULT`

### Mnemonics:

> Feel free to come up with your own or even suggest some!

1. Taking the middle out of "ment" gives "mt" which is what `-PLT` represents
2. Taking the middle out of "let" gives "lt" which is what `-LT` represents

### Section practice

Unfortunately, there is not a lot of practice material for single stroke words containing these chords.

## Right hand bl and bility

* `-BL` represents several different sounds:
   - "-bl" as in "dou<ins>bl</ins>e"
   - "-abl" as in "pli<ins>abl</ins>e"
   - "-ibl" as in "poss<ins>ibl</ins>e"
   - "-b_l" as in "glo<ins>bal</ins>", "mo<ins>bil</ins>e", "la<ins>bel</ins>"

All these sounds are similar to one another in that they all contain "bl" and optionally an **unstressed vowel**. This refers to a vowel that isn't emphasized. Think about how you would say the phrase "lay bell" versus the word "label". In the first case, the "e" is stressed while in the second case, it is not.

### Examples

* pebble `PEBL`
* wobble `WOBL`
* playable `PHRAEUBL`
* chewable `KHAOUBL`
* tribal `TRAOEUBL`
* rebel `REBL`

> **NOTE:** the word "rebel" can be pronounced as `RAOE/PWEL` or `REBL` depending on if it is a verb or a noun. While the dictionary contains both, the single stroke variant is recommended as it is faster.

### Mnemonics:

> Feel free to come up with your own or even suggest some!

1. `-BL` already looks a lot like the sounds it represents, you just have to remember that you can skip over unstressed vowels as well.

## Chapter 11 test

This chapter's test consists of all the practice drills in this chapter. Make sure your settings are configured as such:

![test settings](img/5-test-settings.png)

* Limit word count: 45
* Start from word: 1
* Repetitions: 3
* Sort: random
* Show hint for every word: unchecked
* Hide hint on last repetition: unchecked
* Show hint on misstroke: checked

### Recommended completion goal

This is only a suggestion; it is not a requirement to move to the next chapter!

**Aim for 10–30 WPM with 90% accuracy.**

**You may use the test material as practice!**
