## Intro

All the chords covered so far represent single sounds. However, there are some chords (particularly on the right hand) that can represent multiple syllables. These are referred to as compound clusters.

## Right hand shun, kshun, and x

* `-GS` is "-shun" as in "o<ins>cean</ins>"
* `-BGS` represents two sounds:
  - "-x" as in "ta<ins>x</ins>"
  - "-kshun" as in in "fri<ins>ction</ins>"

### Examples
* motion `PHOEGS`
* caution `KAUGS`
* fax `TPABGS`
* tex `TEBGS`

### "-kshun" and "-x" conflicts
Some words like "a<ins>x</ins>e" and "a<ins>ction</ins>" conflict with the same outline: `ABGS`. In these cases, the "-x" sound is given higher priority and "-kshun" sound is relegated to `*BGS` (same chord, but with the asterisk key).

#### Examples

* faction `TPA*BGS` (since `TPABGS` is already "fax")
* section `S*EBGS` (since `SEBGS` is already "sex")

### Mnemonics:

1. "mu<ins>gs</ins> in the o<ins>cean</ins>"
2. `-BGS` as the "-x" chord is simply just the combination of the "-k" chord `-BG` and the `-S` key
3. `-BGS` as the "-kshun" chord overlaps with the "-k" chord `-BG` and the "-shun" chord `-GS`

## Right hand ment and let

* `-PLT` is "-ment" as in "mo<ins>ment</ins>"
* `-LT` is "-let" as in "scar<ins>let</ins>"

![ment, let](img/11-ment-let.png)

### Examples
* garment `TKPWARPLT`
* torment `TORPLT`
* roulette `RAOULT`
* wallet `WAULT`

### Mnemonics:

> Feel free to come up with your own or even suggest some!

1. Taking the middle out of "ment" gives "mt" which is what `-PLT` represents
2. Taking the middle out of "let" gives "lt" which is what `-LT` represents

### Section practice

[Right hand ment and let words](practice/11-right-ment-and-let.txt)

Unfortunately, there is not a lot of practice material for single stroke words containing these chords.

## Right hand `-BL`

* `-BL` represents several different sounds:
   - "-bl" as in "dou<ins>bl</ins>e"
   - "-abl" as in "pli<ins>abl</ins>e"
   - "-ibl" as in "poss<ins>ibl</ins>e"
   - "-b_l" as in "glo<ins>bal</ins>", "mo<ins>bil</ins>e", "la<ins>bel</ins>"

All these sounds are similar to one another in that they all contain "bl" and optionally an **unstressed vowel**. This refers to a vowel that isn't emphasized. Think about how the phrase "lay bell" differs in sound to the word "label". In the first case, the "e" is stressed while in the second case, it is not.

### Examples

* pebble `PEBL`
* wobble `WOBL`
* playable `PHRAEUBL`
* chewable `KHAOUBL`
* tribal `TRAOEUBL`
* rebel `REBL`

> **NOTE:** the word "rebel" can be pronounced as `RAOE/PWEL` or `REBL` depending on if it is a verb or a noun. While the dictionary contains both, the single stroke variant is recommended as it is faster.

### Mnemonics:

> Feel free to come up with your own or even suggest some!

1. `-BL` already looks a lot like the sounds it represents; remember to skip over any unstressed vowels as well.
