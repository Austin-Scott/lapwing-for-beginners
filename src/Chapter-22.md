# Chapter 22: Theory principles wrap-up

## Intro
This page serves as a reference for all the miscellaneous theory principles that only apply to a few words. It's not important to explicitly memorize the content on this page, as it is very likely these situations will arise in everyday writing.

When you do find odd entries via the lookup tool, first consult this page. If you cannot find an explanation, free to contact me on Discord (@aerbg) or [start a discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/aerickt/lapwing-for-beginners/discussions) (login required). It may be that I have not yet documented the oddity here or that the entry itself may be incorrect.

## Acronyms

For capitalized acronyms, Lapwing treats these as regular words for the most part. Write the first stroke with the asterisk and the number key, but continue the rest of the acronym with regular theory rules. It is generally okay to break steno order. Usually writing an acronym involves spelling the letters it is made up of. For short acronyms, it can also be faster to fingerspell.

- AWOL `#A*EU/WOL`
- LAN `#HRA*PB`
- PDF `#P*FD`

## Contractions

Contractions are written like regular words, but with the asterisk key.


Some common contractions:

| Contraction | Outline |
| ---- | ---- |
| he's | `HAO*ES` |
| he'll | `HAO*EL` |
| we're | `WAO*ER` |
| who's | `WHO*S` |

Some contractions that are based off of common words that are briefed in Lapwing are written a bit less intuitively:

| Contraction | Outline |
| ---- | ---- |
| what's | `WHA*S` |
| that's | `THA*S` |

## `-RB` for "-rb" vs "-sh"

Sometimes it can be ambiguous whether `-RB` represents "-rb" or "-sh" as in the following pair of words:

* cash
* carb

In these cases, "-sh" gets precedence and the word with "-rb" is instead asterisked.

## Disambiguating "ou" with `OU`

Lapwing is somewhat strict in using `OU` only phonetically. However, for cases where where existing outlines with `OU` do not exist, it is generally okay to use this chord for disambiguation.

* `TPOUR` four
  * `TPOR` is already "for^"
* `SOUL` soul
  * `SOEL` is already "sole"
* `PHOURPB` mourn*
  * `PHORPB` is already "morn"

\* Not in the Lapwing dictionary

## Tricky "ou" words

In some accents, the words "tour" and "mourn" would be written like `TOR` and `PHORPB`. However, since these two outlines already exist as other words, Lapwing uses `AOUR` instead. The reasoning for this is that this pronunciation of "tour" is more standard in a North American accent.

* `PHAOURPB` mourn
* `TAOUR` tour

## `W` for glides

For some words, using `W` for a glide might be closer phonetically:

* `EBG/WEU/TEU` equity
* `EBGS/TEUPBG/WEURB` extinguish
* `EUPB/TAOU/WEU/TEUF` intuitive
* `AOU/PWEUBG/WEU/TEU` ubiquity

## "-graph" words

### "-graph"

Write the first part as if it is its own standalone word and then use `TKPWRAF` to write the "-graph" part separately:

* `AU/TOE/TKPWRAF` autograph
* `PAEUR/KWRA/TKPWRAF` paragraph
* `PHEUPL/KWROE/TKPWRAF` mimeograph
* `TE/HRE/TKPWRAF` telegraph

### "-graphy"

Write the "-graph" part separately and then use the `KWREU` suffix to add the "-y":

* `SKWRAOE/KWRO/TKPWRAF/KWREU` geography
* `OR/THO/TKPWRAF/KWREU` orthography
* `STE/TPHO/TKPWRAF/KWREU` stenography
* `SREUD/KWRO/TKPWRAF/KWREU` videography

### Alternative "-graphy" outline

`TKPWRAEF` can be used as a shorter stroke for "-graphy":

* `SKWRAOE/KWRO/TKPWRAEF` geography
* `OR/THO/TKPWRAEF` orthography
* `STE/TPHO/TKPWRAEF` stenography
* `SREUD/KWRO/TKPWRAEF` videography

This alternative outline uses e-folding.

### "-grapher"

Write the "-graph" part separately and then use the `*ER` suffix to add the "-er":

* `KAR/TO/TKPWRAF/*ER` cartographer
* `KHOR/KWRO/TKPWRAF/*ER` choreographer
* `HREBG/SEU/KO/TKPWRAF/*ER` lexicographer
* `OEGS/KWRO/TKPWRAF/*ER` oceanographer

### Alternative "-grapher" outline

Instead of `TKPWRAF/*ER`, you can also use `TKPWRAFR`:

* `KAR/TO/TKPWRAFR` cartographer
* `KHOR/KWRO/TKPWRAFR` choreographer
* `HREBG/SEU/KO/TKPWRAFR` lexicographer
* `OEGS/KWRO/TKPWRAFR` oceanographer

This uses a briefing technique where `-FR` can represent the "fer" sound.

### "-graphic"

Write the "-graph" part separately and then use the `KWREUBG` suffix to add the "-ic":

* `*ET/TPHOE/TKPWRAF/KWREUBG` ethnographic
* `HO/HRO/TKPWRA*F/KWREUBG` holographic
* `EUPB/TPOE/TKPWRAF/KWREUBG` infographic
* `PEUBG/TO/TKPWRAF/KWREUBG` pictographic

### Alternative "-graphic" outline

Instead of `TKPWRAF/KWREUBG`, you can also use `TKPWRAFBG`:

* `*ET/TPHOE/TKPWRAFBG` ethnographic
* `HO/HRO/TKPWRAFBG` holographic
* `EUPB/TPOE/TKPWRAFBG` infographic
* `PEUBG/TO/TKPWRAFBG` pictographic

This alternative outline employs dropping the unstressed "i" in "graph<s>i</s>c".

## "-ology" words
These are written using regular syllabic splitting:

* `ARBG/KWRO/HRO/SKWREU` archaeology
* `A/STRO/HRO/SKWREU` astrology
* `AOE/KO/HRO/SKWREU` ecology
* `OR/TPHEU/THO/HRO/SKWREU` ornithology

### Alternative "-ology" chord

Instead of writing the `O/HRO/SKWREU` cluster, you can instead use the `OLG` chord.

* `ARBG/KWROLG` archaeology
* `A/STROLG` astrology
* `AOE/KOLG` ecology
* `OR/TPHEU/THOLG` ornithology

This is simply just a briefing pattern. These outlines are much shorter than the write-outs and are highly recommended.

## Ambiguous glide vowels

In some words containing glides represented with `KWR` or `W`, the proceeding vowel sound is spelled with two letters. The sound itself is an unstressed schwa (a *short vowel*), and so the **second** vowel letter is what determines which key to use.

Here are some examples to illustrate:

* `KAF/KWRAT` cave**a**t
* `KORPB/KWRAL` corne**a**l
* `HRAOEPB/KWREPBS` leni**e**nce
* `PHA/TREU/HREUPB/KWRAL` matriline**a**l

Another way of thinking about this is that the `KWR` or the `W` glide represents the first vowel letter and the second vowel letter is represented by the vowel key in the steno stroke.

## "-ual" words

It is very difficult to write the "-ual" sound using regular syllabic splitting rules. For example, to write the word "manual" in a way that the second stroke begins with a consonant is only possible as `PHA/TPHAOU`. It is possible to finish the word with `WAL`, but three strokes for such a short word is not very fast indeed. Instead, the `WAL` stroke on its own can represent the entire "-ual" cluster. Thus, by including the "n" consonant in the first stroke, it is possible to write this word with only two: `PHAPB/WAL`.

### `WAL`

Another way of thinking of the `WAL` stroke is that the `W` key represents the "u", and the `AL` represents the "al".

* `AOEBG/WAL` equal
* `HA/PWEUFP/WAL` habitual
* `PER/PEFP/WAL` perpetual
* `AOURB/WAL` usual

It can also be used like a suffix:

* `KOPB/TRABGT/WAL` contractual
* `KOPB/TEGT/WAL` contextual
* `HA/PWEUT/WAL` habitual
* `SEBGS/WAL` sexual

### `TWAL`

You can also use `TWAL` as the "chwal" cluster like in the following words:

* `TPABG/TWAL` factual
* `HA/PWEU/TWAL` habitual
* `EUPB/TE/HREBG/TWAL` intellectual
* `SREUR/TWAL` virtual

I prefer using `TWAL` over `WAL` (when possible) as it more closely resembles the pronunciation it is supposed to represent.

### `KWRAOUL`

You are also free to come up with your own strokes for dealing with these words. In hindsight, `KWRAOUL` would be a better fit to some of these words. I am already accustomed to `WAL`, so I am not about to change these around. That said, if `PHA/TPHAOU/WAL` or `PHA/TPHAOUL` make more sense to you, add it to your dictionary!

## Doubling consonants with prefixes

With prefix strokes, doubling consonants between two strokes is allowed if it makes sense to do so.

- `EUPL/PHOE/PWAOEUL` immobile
   - `EUPL` is the "im-" prefix
- need more examples

There can also be alternative strokes that exist in the dictionary (for example, `EUPL/KWROE/PWAOEUL`). Use whichever makes the most sense to you, or add your own!

## Splitting a sound at "ng"

To split a word at "ng", use `...PBG/TKPW...`

There are also two other alternative splitting methods:

1. `...PB/TKPW...`
2. `...PBG/KWR...`

### Examples

* bingo `PWEUPBG/TKPWOE` or `PWEUPB/TKPWOE` or `PWEUPBG/KWROE`
* tango `TAPBG/TKPWOE` or `TAPB/TKPWOE` or `TAPBG/KWROE`

## Prefix outline conflicts

### Single stroke briefed prefixes

Here are once again the tables from chapter 12 and 15:

| Prefix/word | Prefix Outline | Recommended word outline(s) | Explanation |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| a | `A` | `AEU` | `A*` is already used. |
| bi^ (by) | `PWAOEU` | `PWEU` | There is a three way conflict between "by", "bye", and "buy". |
| be | `PWE` | `-B` | Useful in phrase briefs. |
| for | `TPOR` | `TP-R` or `TPAURT` | Useful in phrases like "for the" `TP-RT`. |
| in | `EUPB` | `TPH` | Useful in phrases like "in the" `TPH-T`. |
| or | `OR` | `AOUR` or `AUR` | `O*R` is already used (see below). |
| out | `OUT` | `AOUT` | Alternative vowel chord. |
| on | `OPB` | `AUPB` | Alternative vowel chord. |
| tri^ (try) | `TRAOEU` | `TRAO*EU` or `TREU` | The first is the more "formal" outline, but the second matches the pattern with "by". |

#### Three way conflict between "by", "bye", and "buy":

| Word | Outline |
| ---- | ---- |
| by | `PWEU` |
| bye | `PW*EU` |
| buy | `PWAO*EU` |

Again, feel free to change around these outlines.

### Generic way of dealing with multisyllable prefix outlines

Press the asterisk in the last stroke of a multisyllable outline to get the word variant.

| Prefix/word | Prefix Outline | Word Outline |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| auto | `AU/TOE` | `AU/TO*E` |
| intro | `EUPB/TROE` | `EUPB/TRO*E` |
| over | `OE/SRER` | `OE/SR*ER` |
| under | `UPB/TKER` | `UPB/TK*ER` |

Some of these can also be briefed. Feel free to use the look up and discover briefs.

### Special conflicts

Another technique for disambiguating between prefixes and words is using alternative vowels. One common case is using `AU` instead of `OE` and `O`. This is sometimes recommended over using the asterisk key as it is much easier to press:

| Prefix/word | Prefix Outline | Word outline |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| on | `OPB` | `AUPB` |
| or | `OR` | `AUR` |
| over | `OEFR` | `AUFR` |
| off |`OF` | `AUF` |

### Prefix strokes vs compound words

Sometimes it can be arbitrary to determine whether a word should be written as a compound word rather than a word with a prefix. For example, the Lapwing dictionary by default treats words like "upright" and "downwards" as compound words; they can be only be written as `UP/RAO*EUT` and `TKOUPB/WA*RD/-Z`. It is perfectly reasonable to make changes and add extra prefix strokes if desired.

## Strokes starting with `EU`

For words like "illuminate" and "immense", there are multiple way valid outlines.

### Syllabically

First, these words can be written using the same syllabic splitting rules in chapter 15.

* illuminate `EU/HRAOU/PHEU/TPHAEUT`
* immense `EU/PHEPBS`

### Prefixes

For some words like "illuminate" and "immobilize", it is natural to use predictions:

* illuminate `EUL/HRAOU/PHEU/TPHAEUT`
* immobilize `EUPL/PHOEBL/KWRAOEUZ`

Normally, two consonant chords cannot be doubled across two strokes. In the "immobilize" outline, the `-PL` and `PH` chords are next to each other in the first and second strokes. However, since the first stroke `EUPL` is a prefix, this is allowed.

### Incorrect prefixes

For some other words like "immense" and "immune", using a prefix would not make much sense since the remaining letters would not form a word ("mense" and "mune" are not words). However, words starting with `EU` are exempt from this rule. Therefore, the following outlines are all valid:

* immense `EUPL/KWREPBS` or `EUPL/PHEPBS`
* immune `EUPL/KWRAOUPB` or `EUPL/PHAOUPB`

### Why

Since `EU` on its own is the word "I", I originally had concerns that outlines like `EU/HREUFT` and `EU/SHAOU` would cause some issues. Therefore, I opted to make all of these words not adhere to syllabic splitting, and instead force them to be written with prefixes. However, upon closer examination, there are not very many conflicts. Therefore, I've added the syllabic splitting outlines, and am keeping the others as fallbacks. Eventually, the incorrect prefixes may be removed.

## Words ending in "h"

The asterisk `*` key is used for words ending in "h".

* hah `HA*`
* heh `H*E`
* meh `PH*E`

## Problematic words

This table contains words that don't quite follow main theory principles.

| Word | Recommended outline | Explanation |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| ah | `A*E` | `A*` is already used for fingerspelling, so `AE` is used to disambiguate. |
| alt | `ALT` | `AULT` is the canonical outline, but "all the" is a more useful phrase and is given priority. |
| cache | `KAERB` | `KARB` and `KA*RB` are both already used as "cash" and "carb" so the `E` key is used to disambiguate. |
| doth | `TKA*UT` | `TKO*T` is assigned to the more common phrase "do the". |
| fore | `TPOER` | `TPOR` and `TPO*R` are already used so we use the `E` as a disambiguation key. |
| herein | `HAOER/KWREUPB` or `HAOERPB` | It's not recommended to treat this as a compound word as it would use a fingerspelling stroke: `HAOER/TPH*`.
| hi | `HEU` | `HAOEU` is the word "high" already. |
| hour | `HOUR` | `OUR` is already used so the `H` key is added even though it is silent. |
| lunch | `HRUFRPBLG` | `HRUFRPB` is already used so `-LG` is used as a disambiguation chord. This is recommended over `HR*UFRPB` as it is slightly easier to press.|
| nought | `TPHA*UT` | `TPHAUT`, `TPHOT`, and `TPHO*T` are already used. |
| poll/pole | `POL`/`POEL` | No real reason. Feel free to change things around and/or use the asterisk key for disambiguation. |
| scene | `SKAOEPB` | `SAOEPB` is already the word "seen" so "scene" is written with the `K` to disambiguate. |
| wolf | `WOEFL` or `WOFL` | While you could write this as `WOEL/*F` or `WOL/*F`, it's just much faster to learn one of these briefs. |
| werewolf | lots of outlines | You can use `WAEUR` or `WER` for the first stroke. However, if you use `WER`, you will have to to asterisk the second word since there is a potential conflict between the phrase "were wolves" and the word "werewolves". |
