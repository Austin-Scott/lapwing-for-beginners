# Lapwing for Beginners

Welcome to Lapwing for beginnersâ€”the online book for hobbyists to teach themselves stenography with Lapwing theory!

To get started:

* as a complete beginner: [Chapter 1](Chapter-01.md)
* as a current Plover user thinking about switching to Lapwing: [Appendix A](Appendix-A.md)

> **NOTE:** setting up Lapwing with the Plover app is covered in [Chapter 5](Chapter-05.md).

This resource is still in development and feedback is highly appreciated. You can reach out to me by:

* posting a message on the [Plover Discord server's <code class="code-mono">lapwing-theory</code> channel](https://discord.gg/rvKuMeem7k)
* creating a new post on [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/aerickt/lapwing-for-beginners/discussions/new/choose)

## Motivation

In early 2022, I was dissatisfied with the state of learning resources for Plover theory and started working on a new dictionary. However, throughout this process, I realized that Plover theory itself had many gaps and adding all the valid outlines would be impossible. I added more and more rules to account for these theory gaps, and slowly the entire project diverged far enough from Plover to be considered its own theory.

Over two years later, Lapwing is used by several community members and is a regarded as a viable theory to learn. I created this resource to make stenography more accessible to hobbyists.
