## Right hand -v

* "v" as in  in "ca<ins>v</ins>e" is `-F`

### Examples
* solve `SOF`
* move `PHAOUF`
* love `HROF`

### Mnemonics:

> Feel free to come up with your own or even suggest some!

1. The "v" sound is quite similar to "f" ("v" is simply voiced "f")

### Conflicts with f

With `-F` as both "f" and "v", conflicts such as "safe" and "save" can arise; both of these would be written as `SAEUF`. In these cases, `-F` is reserved for the word spelled with "f" and `*F` is used for the word spelled with "v":

* safe `SAEUF`
* save `SA*EUF`
* waif `WAEUF`
* waive `WA*EUF`

### Examples

* lark `HRARBG`
* sack `SABG`

### Mnemonics

1. Each of these chords are simply two keys in a row
   * `-PL` is the top row pressed by the middle and ring fingers
   * `-BG` is the bottom row pressed by the middle and ring fingers
2. Think "<ins>pl</ins>u<ins>m</ins>" for `-PL`
