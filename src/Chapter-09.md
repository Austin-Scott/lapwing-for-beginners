## Right hand v

* "v" as in  in "ca<ins>v</ins>e" is `-F`

### Examples
* solve `SOF`
* move `PHAOUF`
* love `HROF`

### Mnemonics:

> Feel free to come up with your own or even suggest some!

1. The "v" sound is quite similar to "f" ("v" is simply voiced "f")

### Conflicts with f

With `-F` as both "f" and "v", conflicts such as "safe" and "save" can arise; both of these would be written as `SAEUF`. In these cases, `-F` is reserved for the word spelled with "f" and `*F` is used for the word spelled with "v":

* safe `SAEUF`
* save `SA*EUF`
* waif `WAEUF`
* waive `WA*EUF`

## Right hand st

In chapter 5, and it was stated that "-st" in words like "past" cannot be written in a way that obeys steno order. In Lapwing theory, `-FT` can be used to represent this sound.

* cast `KAFT`
* fast `TPAFT`
* haste `HAEUFT`
* mast `PHAFT`

For conflicts, `*S` is used as a secondary chord. Words with "-ft" are given higher priority than words with "-st".

* lost `HRO*S` (`HROFT` is already "loft")
* list `HR*EUS` (`HREUFT` is already "lift")

#### Section practice

This section's practice material also includes some "-ft" words like "loft" and "lift".

## Right hand m and k

* `-PL` is "-m" as in "cal<ins>m</ins>"
* `-BG` is "k" as in "ba<ins>ck</ins>"

![m and k](img/9-m-k.png)

### Examples

* crumb `KRUPL`
* form `TPORPL`
* lark `HRARBG`
* sack `SABG`

### Mnemonics

1. Each of these chords are simply two keys in a row
   * `-PL` is the top row pressed by the middle and ring fingers
   * `-BG` is the bottom row pressed by the middle and ring fingers
2. Think "<ins>pl</ins>u<ins>m</ins>" for `-PL`

## Right hand mp, th, and lk

* `*PL` is "-mp" as in "bu<ins>mp</ins>"
* `*T` is "-th" as in "pa<ins>th</ins>"
* `*LG` is "-lk" as in "ca<ins>lc</ins>"

![mp th and lk](img/9-mp-th-lk.png)

### Examples

* crimp `KR*EUPL`
* shrimp `SHR*EUPL`
* bath `PWA*T`
* moth `PHO*T`
* elk `*ELG`
* talc `TA*LG`

### Mnemonics
> Feel free to come up with your own or even suggest some!

1. `*PL` is the "m" chord with an asterisk
2. `*T` is the `-T` key with an asterisk
3. The "g" and "k" sounds are quite similar and `*LG` is the `-LG` chord with an asterisk
