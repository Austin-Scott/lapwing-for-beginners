# Chapter 24: Shortening techniques

## Introduction

Basic theory in Lapwing gives the rules for splitting complicated words into individual steno strokes—usually with one stroke corresponding to one syllable. However, this is not terribly efficient. To put this into perspective, professional stenographers have to write 225 WPM (or 5.25 syllables per second) to graduate. Even for professionals, 5 strokes per second is almost too fast.

Instead of relying entirely on finger speed, steno outlines can be shortened. This is done through various techniques that either compress more sounds into each stroke, or drop unnecessary sounds altogether. These shortening techniques are not applicable to any arbitrary word (nor are they entirely conflict free), but they can still be extremely helpful for whole families of words.

## Folding

Folding is a technique where a key (or chord) is inserted into a stroke to represent a sound that is typically found at the end of a word.

### R-folding

Folding `-R` into a stroke can add an ending "r" sound like in the following examples:

- equator `AOE/KWAEURT` = `AOE/KWAEUT` + `-R`
- humor `HAOURPL` = `HAOUPL` + `-R`
- modulator `PHO/SKWRAOU/HRAEURT` = `PHO/SKWRAOU/HRAEUT` + `-R`
- shimmer `SHEURPL` = `SHEUPL` + `-R`

Some outlines using this technique would conflict with preexisting words (e.g., `TARP` for "tarp" or "tapper"). In cases where `A` is the vowel, `AE` can be used as an alternative vowel chord.

- hammer `HAERPL` = `HAPL` + `ER`
- tapper `TAERP` = `HAPL` + `ER`

> R-folding is **high in conflicts for single stroke outlines** but **low in conflicts for multistroke outlines**. It is safe to use this technique for ending multistroke words.

### L-folding

Folding `-L` into a stroke can add a sound containing the "l" consonant on the end of the word. Usually this is the "-ly" or "l" sound as in the following examples:

- mostly `PHOEFLT` = `PHOEFT` + `-L`
- portal `PORLT` = `PORT` + `-L`
- final `TPAOEUPBL` = `TPAOEUPB` + `-L`
- funnel `TPUPBL` = `TPUPB` + `-L`

This technique mostly fails whenever the steno outline already has the `-L` key in it, or if the stroke is too difficult to press. In these cases, folding the initial `HR` can sometimes work.

- finally `TPHRAOEUPBL` = `TPAOEUPB` + `-L` + `HR`
- basically `PWHRAEUFBG` = `PWAEUFBG`\* + `HR`

\**See section below on dropping unstressed vowels.*

> L-folding is **low in conflicts**; use it whenever possible.

### T-folding

Folding `-T` can add the "-ity" or "-ty" clusters to the end of a word:

- entirety `EPB/TAOEURT` = `EPB/TAOEUR` + `-T`
- eternity `AOE/TERPBT` = `AOE/TERPB` + `-T`
- porosity `POR/KWROFT` = `POR/KWROF` + `-T`
- sanity `SAPBT` = `SAPB` + `-T`

> T-folding is **low in conflicts**; use it whenever possible.

> Using this technique might lead to difficult chords to press like `-TD`. Do not feel obliged to use T-folding in these scenarios.

### E-folding

A *long e* /i/ vowel at the end of a word can be represented by folding the `E` key into a stroke:

- auditory `AU/TKEU/TOER` = `AU/TKEU/TOR` + `E`
- respiratory `RES/PRA/TOER` = `RES/PRA/TOR` + `E`
- antimony `APB/TEU/PHOEPB` = `APB/TEU/PHOPB` + `E`
- coffee `KOEF` = `KOF` + `E`
- crumbly `KRUPL/EBL` = `KRUPL/-BL` + `E`
- humbly `HUPL/EBL` = `HUPL/-BL` + `E`
- numerically `TPHAOU/PHER/KAEL` = `TPHAOU/PHER/KAL` + `E`
- symbolically `SOPL/PWOL/KAEL` = `SEUPL/PWOL/KAL` + `E`
- carefully `KAEUR/EFL` = `KAEUR/-FL` + `E`
- dreadfully `TKRED/EFL` = `TKRED/-FL` + `E`
- happy `HAEP` = `HAP` + `E`
  * happier `HAERP` (`E` and `-R` folding)
- fancy `TPAEPBS` = `TPAPBS` + `E`
  * fancier `TPAERPBS` (`E` and `-R` folding)

### E-folding with `AEU`

Instead of writing two strokes for words ending in "-ary", `...AER` can represent this sound in one stroke:

- carry `KAER`
- estuary `ES/KHAOU/KWRAER`
- corollary `KOR/KWRO/HRAER`
- solitary `SO/HREU/TAER`

> E-folding is **high in conflicts for single stroke outlines** but **low in conflicts for multistroke outlines**. It is safe to use this technique for ending multistroke words.

## Dropping unstressed vowels

> Keep in mind this only applies to General North American English

In conversational speech, a lot of vowels typically aren't emphasized. For example, the first "e" in the word "elephant" is enunciated very clearly, but the second is not. This second "e" can be dropped without affecting the pronunciation significantly. For example, listen to the two ways of saying "elephant":

<video controls>
<source src="img/24-pronunciations-1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Dropping the second "e" in "elephant" is advantageous; it is now now possible to write this word in two strokes instead of one: `EL/TPA*PBT`.

This technique can be tricky, and it doesn't always work with any arbitrary word. A great way to learn stress identification is to practice it in everyday life. When reading a word, pay attention to the vowels that aren't emphasized. In particular, try dropping vowels from a word and observing if the word is still intelligible. For example, try saying "elephant" out loud in the two ways shown above. When reading the next few examples, try this out yourself.

### definite

Write-out: `TKE/TPEU/TPHEUT`

Unstressed vowel(s) dropped: def<s>i</s>nite → defnit

The first "i" is unstressed and the "f" can be moved to the right hand.

Shorter outline: `TKEF/TPHEUT`

### demand

Write-out: `TKE/PHAPBD`

Unstressed vowel(s) dropped: d<s>e</s>mand → dmand

The "e" is unstressed and the "dm" cluster can be moved to the left hand with `TKPH`.

Shorter outline: `TKPHAPBD`

### deplorable

Write-out: `TKE/PHROR/-BL`

Unstressed vowel(s) dropped: d<s>e</s>plor<s>a</s>ble → dplorbl

Every vowel except the "o" can be dropped. The resulting consonants can easily fit on the steno layout.

Shorter outline: `TKPHROBL`

### derivative

Write-out: `TKE/REU/SRA/TEUF`

Unstressed vowel(s) dropped: d<s>e</s>riv<s>a</s>tive → drivtive

The "e" and the "a" are dropped.

Unstressed vowel(s) dropped: <s>e</s>lectric → lectric

First vowel can be dropped.

Shorter outline: `HREBG/TREUBG`

### differ

Write-out: `TKEU/TPER`

Unstressed vowel(s) dropped: diff<s>e</s>r → difr

The "e" can be dropped and the "f" and "r" can be moved to the right hand with `-FR`.

Shorter outline: `TKEUFR`

### engineer

Write-out: `EPB/SKWREU/TPHAOER`

Unstressed vowel(s) dropped: eng<s>i</s>neer

The "i" can be dropped so that the "ng" sound can represented with `-PBG` on the right hand.

Shorter outline: `EPBG/TPHAOER`

### geology

Write-out: `SKWRAOE/KWRO/HRO/SKWREU`

Unstressed vowel(s) dropped: geol<s>o</s>gy → geolgy

The second "o" can be dropped and the "l" can be moved to the right hand.

Shorter outline: `SKWRAOE/KWROL/SKWREU`

### modulator

Write-out: `PHO/SKWRAOU/HRAEUT/O*R`

Unstressed vowel (s) dropped: mod<s>u</s>lator → modlator

The "u" can be dropped and the j sound can be moved to the right hand.

Shorter outline: `PHOPBLG/HRAEUT/O*R`

> **NOTE:** this can be combined with R-folding: `PHOPBLG/HRAEURT`!

### possible

Write-out: `PO/SEUBL`

Unstressed vowel(s) dropped: poss<s>i</s>ble → posbl

The "i" is unstressed, and the "s" can be represented with `-F`.

Shorter outline: `POFBL`

### suppose

Write-out: `SU/POES`

Unstressed vowel(s) dropped: s<s>u</s>ppose → sppose

The "u" is unstressed.

Shorter outline: `SPOES`

### Tom Scott and schwa

In many of these examples, the unstressed vowel is a schwa. This sound is always unstressed, and therefore can be dropped whenever possible. Identifying schwas quickly can therefore be very beneficial to automatically dropping unstressed vowels. Tom Scott has created a helpful video on understanding this sound which I highly encourage watching:

<iframe width="640" height="360"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qu4zyRqILYM">
</iframe> 

> At 2:41, Tom mentions three words where the schwa is dropped entirely in spoken word. Instead of writing these words in three strokes like, `SE/PAR/KWRAT`, `KHO/KO/HRAT`, and `KA/PHER/KWRA`, can you think of two stroke outlines for each?

> As an exercise, you can try looking back at the previous examples and identify the schwas. Note that not all unstressed vowels are schwas, and not all schwas in the examples are necessarily dropped.

### Caveats

Sometimes this technique doesn't work for a few reasons. First of all, the shortened outline might already conflict with another valid word. Here are some examples:

- `PWOUT` can be "bout" or "about"


This technique may also fail if there are too many consonants in the shortened word. For example, in the word "consonant", every other vowel after the first "o" is unstressed:

- cons<s>o</s>n<s>a</s>nt → consnnt

However, it is not possible to include the "n" two times on the right side of the steno layout. We can, however, write it in two strokes as `KOPBS/TPHAPBT`.

> If you're brave, `KOFPBT` could be a valid outline!

### Practice material

## Inversions

It is sometimes acceptable to break steno order when shortening outlines. It is especially helpful to invert the order of two keys for some words where dropping unstressed vowels is not enough. For example, in the word "fabricate", the "i" can be dropped:

* fabr<s>i</s>cate → fabrcate

Despite this, it is still not possible to represent the resulting sound in two strokes; the "br" cluster is problematic and forces the use of three: `TPAB/R/KAEUT`. This is where an inversion can be helpful—if the `R` key moved to the previous stroke, this word can be written in two strokes: `TPARB/KAEUT`.

### Examples

* migr<s>a</s>tory `PHAOEURG/TOER`
* secr<s>e</s>tary `SERBG/TAER`
* patr<s>i</s>mony `PART/PHOEPB`
* b<s>e</s>side `SPWAOEUD`

## Left hand compound clusters

In addition to the left hand chords learned in the very early chapters, there are also more advanced chords that can represent more than just a single consonant.

* `SPW` is "int" or "ent" as in "<ins>ent</ins>ire" or "<ins>int</ins>ern"
* `KP` is "comp" as in "<ins>comp</ins>lement"
* `KPW` is "comb" as in "<ins>comb</ins>ine"
* `KPH` is "com" as in "<ins>comm</ins>ent"
* `W` is "v" as in "di<ins>v</ins>ine"
* `STK` is "d_s" as in "<ins>des</ins>ign" or "<ins>dis</ins>arm"

> `KPW`, `KPH`, and `STK` technically aren't compound clusters, but are the result of other shortening techniques. However, it is easy to explicitly remember these as compound clusters as they are quite common.

### Examples

* entire `SPWAOEUR`
* intern `SPWERPB`
* compli<s>a</s>nt `KPHRAOEUPBT`
* compliment `KPHREUPLT`
* commend `KPHEPBD`
* commit `KPHEUT`
* d<s>e</s>vice `TKWAOEUS`
* d<s>i</s>vide `TKWAOEUD`
* decide `STKAOEUD`
* dis<s>a</s>ppear `STKPAOER`

*\*crossing out indicates dropped unstressed vowels.*

> **NOTE:** many of the words in this drill also utilize other techniques.

## Dropping other sounds

Sometimes it may be convenient to arbitrarily drop more sounds to shorten steno outlines. For example, the "n" in "assignment" is not really enunciated, allowing it to be written in two strokes instead of three:

* assignment `A/SAOEUPLT`
  - Instead of `A/SAOEUPB/-PLT`

This technique can also be applied to the following words:

* confinement `KOPB/TPAOEUPLT`
* consignment `KOPB/SAOEUPLT`

> The words that work with this technique depend a lot on your accent and even personal speech patterns. If you find an intuitive outline missing from `lapwing-base.json`, you should not hesitate to add it to your personal dictionary.

While these last few examples may have been somewhat intuitive, it is also valid to drop sounds arbitrarily whenever a stroke can be saved:

* abutment `A/PWUPLT`
  - first "t" is dropped
* amb<s>i</s>guity `APL/TKPWAOUT`
  - "b" is dropped
* discard `STKARD`
  - "c" is dropped
* fragment `TPRAPLT`
  - "g" is dropped
* <s>e</s>fficient `TPEURBT`
  - "n" is dropped
* patient `PAEURBT`
  - "n" is dropped

*\*crossing out indicates dropped unstressed vowels.*

> **NOTE:** this technique depends heavily on if there are existing words the resulting outline may conflict with.

As this technique is highly personal to each individual, it is not particularly useful to drill the words that can be found in the dictionary. Instead, cater this method to your own personal accent and speech patterns when adding new entries to your dictionary. Feel free to learn the shortened outlines in the dictionary that utilize this technique, but you are not at all obliged to follow them.
