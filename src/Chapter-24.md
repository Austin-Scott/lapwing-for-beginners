# Chapter 24: Lapwing briefing techniques

> This page is very incomplete.

## Introduction

While the techniques listed in this page are utilized a lot in Lapwing theory, you may find some briefs missing from the default dictionary. In these cases, feel free to add them to your own personal dictionary.

It's also important to note that briefing techniques are often a lot more hairy than core theory principles you have learned so far, and thus you may run into conflicts with other words when trying to use these techniques. It's up to you to decide how to resolve these conflicts. Remember, at this point, you should be making your dictionary yours!

## Dropping unstressed vowels

### Identifying stress

In some words, there are vowels that are not stressed. In some cases, you can drop these vowels to cut down on the number of strokes needed to write this word.

Stress itself refers to emphasis in a syllable. Let's first go over a few examples and learn how to identify stress, or the lack of it. In the following words, try to think which syllable is emphasized the most:

- discipline
- foxtrot
- mention
- system

The easiest way that I find useful in identifying stress is just pronouncing the word with emphasis on different syllables. To emphasize a syllable, speak it a little louder than the others and say it a bit longer in length.

Let's take the first word; which of the following sounds the the most natural?

1. **dis**cipline
2. dis**ci**pline
3. disci**pline**

Hopefully it should be clear that the first way sounds the most natural and therefore we can conclude that "discipline" has its stress on the first syllable. 2 and 3 should sound like you are [putting the wrong em**pha**sis on the wrong syl**la**ble](https://youtu.be/pmh_6z9AWfc).

You should also arrive at the conclusion that the other 3 words listed above have their stress on the first syllable. If you are ever unsure, you can always look up a word in a dictionary like Merriam Webster and find the IPA.

The boxed symbol denotes that the following syllable contains the primary stress and the circled symbol indicates that the next syllable has the secondary stress. Don't worry too much about primary vs secondary stress as later we will only be looking at unstressed syllables.

Stress isn't always on the first syllable, of course. Here are some words with their stressed syllables bolded:

- a**pos**trophe
- be**gin**
- gym**nas**ium
- sys**tem**ic

### Unstressed vowels

Now that you've tried identifying stress, let's go over identifying unstressed vowels within a word. We will use the word "alcohol" in this example.

First try stressing each syllable:

1. **al**cohol
2. al**co**hol
3. alco**hol**

1 sounds the most natural while 2 sounds the most unnatural. Therefore, we know for sure this is unstressed. Normally, if you were simply writing out this word, you would write `AL/KO/HOL`.

However, if we dropped the `O` in the second stroke (since that syllable is unstressed) we can actually save a stroke. Using the "-lk" compound cluster, we can instead write "alcohol" like `A*LG/HOL` (pronounced like "alkhol").

Even though we have dropped one of the vowels within this word, the resulting outline is still pronounced more or less like the actual word. This is whole idea of dropping unstressed vowels: we are omitting vowels that don't add much to the pronunciation of a word and shifting around the consonants to reduce the number of strokes.

Time to try it out yourself! Take a look at the following words and identify any unstressed vowels. See if you can save a stroke or two!

#### differ

Write-out: `TKEU/TPER`

Unstressed vowel(s) dropped: diff<s>e</s>r

The stress is on the first syllable and thus we can drop the "e". In the write-out, the "f" consonant is written using the left hand, but if we drop the "e", we can represent the "fr" cluster with `-FR`.

Brief: `TKEUFR`

#### demand

Write-out: `TKE/PHAPBD`

Unstressed vowel(s) dropped: d<s>e</s>mand

The stress is on the second syllable, so we can drop the "e". We can represent the "dm" cluster on the left hand with `TKPH`.

Brief: `TKPHAPBD`

#### geology

Write-out: `SKWRAOE/KWRO/HRO/SKWREU`

Unstressed vowel(s) dropped: geol<s>o</s>gy

We can drop the second "o" and represent the "l" on the right hand.

Brief: `SKWRAOE/KWROL/SKWREU`

#### possible

Write-out: `PO/SEUBL`

Unstressed vowel(s) dropped: poss<s>i</s>ble

The stress is on the first syllable, so we can drop the "i". We can represent the "s" consonant as `-F`.

Brief: `POFBL`

### Caveats

Sometimes this technique doesn't work for a few reasons. First of all, the outline you end up with might already conflict with another valid word. Here are some examples:

- `PWOUT` for "about" or "bout"
- `AEURD` for "arid" or "aired"

The other reason this technique won't always work is simply because there aren't enough consonants on the steno layout. For example, in the word "consonant", the (primary) stress is on the first syllable. However, if we were to drop every other vowel, we could not represent the resulting sound on the steno layout; there just aren't enough consonants to encode "consnnt" (without violating steno order). We can, however, write it in two strokes as `KOPBS/TPHAPBT`.

> If you're brave, `KOFPBT` could be a valid outline!

### Identifying unstressed vowels quickly

Instead of identifying the stressed vowels, you can also try identifying the unstressed vowel by testing what happens if you drop each vowel. You may find this technique more intuitive than the last one.

For example, take the word "carriage" and try dropping the first and second vowels separately:

1. c<s>a</s>rriage
2. carr<s>ia</s>ge

2 sounds more natural, and therefore we could write this word as `KAEURPBLG`.

Both these trial and error techniques work fairly well (at least for me), but they're not something you want to be using while stenoingâ€”it is very slow. Instead, I encourage you to try it on words you encounter everyday.

By practising this a lot, it is possible to completely internalize this process and automatically identify unstressed vowels; this is exactly what you want to achieve and is what I primarily do.

## Folding

Folding suffix keys was introduced in chapter 14, but there are also other keys you can fold into strokes. Unlike suffix keys, these are not handled automatically and are instead explicitly defined in the Lapwing dictionary.

### E-folding

By inserting the `E` key into a vowel chord (called "folding"), you can add a *long e* /i/ vowel to the end of the stroke. This is typically only used for short vowel (`A`, `O`, and `U`) and is only valid if the resulting outline isn't already defined as a separate translation.

### `AE`

This chord can be equivalent to `...A_/KWREU` as in:

- happy `HAEP`

#### `KAEL`

Equivalent outlines: `KAL/KWREU` or `...EU/KAL/KWREU`.

- numerically `TPHAOU/PHER/KAEL`
- symbolically `SEUPL/PWOL/KAEL`

#### `AER`

Equivalent outline: `...AEUR/KWREU`

- carry `KAER`

#### `EBL`

Equivalent outline: `-BL/KWREU`

- crumbly `KRUPL/EBL`
- humbly `HUPL/EBL`
 	
#### `EFL`

This stroke is equivalent to `-FL/KWREU`

- carefully `KAEUR/EFL`
- dreadfully `TKRED/EFL`

### L-folding

Folding `-L` can add the "-ly" suffix to the end of a word.

#### Examples:

- mostly `PHOEFLT`
- partly `PARLT`
- poorly `PAORL`

### T-folding

Folding `-T` can add the "-ity" or "-ty" clusters to the end of a word.

#### Examples:

- eternity `AOE/TERPBT`
- porosity `POR/KWROFT`
