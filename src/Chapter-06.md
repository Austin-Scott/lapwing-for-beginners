# Chapter 6: Left hand consonants continued

## Recommended pace

**Recommended time to spend on this chapter: 2–5 days.**

1. Read [Left hand f, q, and m](#left-hand-f-q-and-m) and complete the drill (**20 minutes**)
   - Repeat the drill as needed
2. Read [left hand g, n, and y](#left-hand-g-n-and-y) and complete the drill (**20 minutes**)
   - Repeat the drill as needed
3. Read [left hand z, v, and j](#left-hand-z-v-and-j) and complete the drill (**20 minutes**)
   - Repeat the drill as needed
4. Attempt the [test](#chapter-6-test) (**20 minutes**)
   * Practise as needed

Remember to take breaks!

## Left hand f, q, and m

* `TP` is "f" as in "<ins>f</ins>ad"
* `KW` is "q" as in "<ins>q</ins>uit"
* `PH` is "m" as in "<ins>m</ins>od"

![f, q, and m on the steno layout](img/6-fqm.png)

### Examples

* far `TPAR`
* flat `TPHRAT`
* quill `KWEUL`
* quip `KWEUP`
* met `PHET`
* more `PHOR`

### Wouldn't `PH` as "f" make more sense? 

Why not use `PH` for "f"? After all, this would be easier to remember since "ph" has the same sound as "f". However, it would be impossible to chord "fl" sounds as the `PH` and `HR` chords overlap. `PHR` already represents the initial "pl" consonants. We would run into ambiguity if we also defined `PHR` to be the "fl" consonants (e.g., "plat" and "flat").

### Mnemonics

> Feel free to come up with your own or even suggest some!

1. Each of these chords are simply two keys in a row
   * `TP` is the top row pressed by the ring and middle fingers
   * `KW` is the bottom row pressed by the ring and middle fingers
   * `PH` is the top row pressed by the middle and index fingers
2. Think "FQM" in steno order (top to bottom, left to right!)
   * <ins>f</ins>ully <ins>q</ins>ualified <ins>m</ins>ountain
   * <ins>f</ins>irst <ins>q</ins>uill <ins>m</ins>ade

## Left hand g, n, and y

* `TKPW` is "g" as in "<ins>g</ins>et"

> **NOTE:** `TKPW` is only used for the "hard g" sound. For example, the word "gel" would not use `TKPW` as the initial consonant is a "soft g" (a "j" sound).

* `TPH` is "n" as in "<ins>n</ins>ot"
* `KWR*` is "y" as in "<ins>y</ins>et"
  * `KWR` is pressed using the left hand ring, middle, and index fingers
  * `*` can be pressed with either the left or right index finger (whichever is more comfortable)

> If you use Plover's lookup tool, you will notice that a lot of words beginning with "y" can be written using `KWR` (without the asterisk). It's recommended that you **don't** use these outlines.

**`KWR*` is only used when the word starts with the letter "y"; if a word has a "y" sound but doesn't start with a "y", simply don't use a left hand consonant chord.**

### Examples

* gloss `TKPWHROS`
* gull `TKPWUL`
* nap `TPHAP`
* net `TPHET`
* yeet `KWRAO*ET`
* yes `KWR*ES`
* use `AOUS`

### Mnemonics

> Feel free to come up with your own or even suggest some!

1. Grapes nourish you
1. `TKPW` is a group of 4 keys pressed by the ring and middle fingers
1. `TPH` is a row of 3 keys pressed by the ring, middle, and index fingers
1. `KWR*` is a row of 4 keys composed of the left hand ring, middle, and index fingers and the right hand index finger (optional)

## Left hand z, v, and j

* `S*` is "z" as in "zit"
* `SR` is "v" as in "vat"
* `SKWR` is "j" as in "job"

![](img/6-zvj.png)

### Mnemonics

> Feel free to come up with your own or even suggest some!

1. The "z" sound is similar to the "s" sound and thus they only differ in the asterisk key
2. The chemical element strontium (symbol <ins>Sr</ins>) is not <ins>v</ins>anadium
3. `SKWR` is just the bottom row of the left hand

### Examples

* zap `SA*P`
* zip `S*EUP`
* var `SRAR`
* ver `SRER`
* jib `SKWREUB`
* jot `SKWROT`
