## Intro

Lapwing theory is very North American centred as that is the dialect of English I am familiar with. However, being from Canada, I often need to use both American and British spellings of words in writing. I've created a dictionary that adds in British spellings with alternative outlines. Unfortunately, this dictionary does not account for pronunciation differences, and it also prioritises the American forms of wordsâ€”there may not always be short briefs available for British spellings.

Ideally, there would be a separate stand-alone lapwing dictionary for British English, but creating one would be very difficult, particularly for someone who does not speak this dialect. If you would like to contribute a lapwing dictionary for British speakers, please do get in touch!

### Setup

Make sure you are using the <code class="code-mono">plover-lapwing-aio</code> plugin, or you have manually configured your dictionary stack by following [these instructions](Appendix-B.md).

## Quick switching

The recommended way to switch from an American word to its British form is by using `#TPH` as a suffix stroke of sorts. This is guaranteed to always work unlike the other methods outlined later.

### Examples

* center `SEPB/TER`
   * centre `SEPB/TER/#TPH`
* fulfill `TPUL/TPEUL`
   * fulfil `TPUL/TPEUL/#TPH`
* harbor `HAR/PWOR`
   * harbour `HAR/PWOR/#TPH`
*  organize `OR/TKPWA/TPHAOEUZ`
   * organise `OR/TKPWA/TPHAOEUZ/#TPH`

### Dealing with suffixes

If you are writing a word with a suffix, you have to switch the word into its British form **first** before writing the suffix.

#### Examples
* organising `OR/TKPWA/TPHAOEUZ/#TPH/-G`
* economises `AOE/KO/TPHO/PHAOEUZ/#TPH/-Z`
* energiser `EPB/KWRER/SKWRAOEUZ/#TPH/*ER`
* immortalised `EUPL/PHOR/TAL/KWRAOEUZ/#TPH/-D`

## ae spellings

Regardless of pronunciation, words that are spelled with "ae" can be written with `AE`.

### Examples

* aetiology `AET/KWROLG`
* encyclopaedia `EPB/SAOEU/KHROE/PAE/TKEU/KWRA` 
* haemoglobin `HAE/PHOE/TKPWHROE/PWEUPB`
* leukaemia `HRAOU/KAEPL/KWRA`


## ise spellings

Words spelled with "ise" can be written by using `-S` instead of `-Z`.

* magnetise `PHAG/PHE/TAOEUS`
* stabiliser `STAEUBL/KWRAOEUS/*ER`
* utilising `AOUT/HRAOEUS/-G`
* initialise `EUPB/KWREURBL/KWRAOEUS`

## oe spellings

Words spelled with "oe" can be written using `OE` regardless of pronunciation.

### Examples
* oedema `OE/TKE/PHA`
* foetus `TPOE/TUS`
* homoeopathy `HOEPL/KWROE/PATH/KWREU`
* oestrogen `OES/TROE/SKWREPB`

#### ou spellings

Words spelled with "ou" can be written using `OU` **only** to disambiguate between British and American spellings.

### Examples
* candour `KAPB/TKOUR`
* colour `KO/HROUR`
* favour `TPAEU/SROUR`
* neighbour `TPHAEU/PWOUR`

## re spellings

For British words spelled with "re" you can use the asterisk key in the stroke containing `ER`.

### Examples
* calibre `KA/HREU/PW*ER`
* litre `HREU/T*ER`
* mitre `PHAOEU/T*ER`
* centimetre `SEPB/TEU/PHAO*ERT`

## Miscellaneous briefs

If adding the asterisk into a brief or other outline exists, then chances are it will work for the British spelling.

### Examples
* metre `PHAO*ERT`
* organise `O*RG`
* neighbour `TPHA*EURB`
