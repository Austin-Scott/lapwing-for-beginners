## Intro
This chapter will cover punctuation and Plover commands. As these are not really tied to any words, they may be less intuitive. Many of these will simply have to be memorized. There is no practice material for this chapter; instead, incorporating steno into daily computer tasks can be a great way to practise these miscellaneous outlines. It may be helpful to print out the punctuation graphic and keep it in a easy to reference location (such as taped to a wall). Playing typing games such as TypeRacer or monkeytype is also a great way to practise steno at this point.

## Punctuation

Punctuation is a lot different to regular words where a space is almost always inserted before. For different punctuation, there may be different scenarios for spacing on one side or the other. Furthermore, punctuation can sometimes also govern the capitalization of the next word. Therefore, punctuation strokes contain special formatting rules to control the spacing and capitalization.

The following table lists several common punctuation marks along with the name, formatting, steno outline, and a mnemonic to aid with memorization.

| Character | Name | Formatting | Steno outline | Mnemonic |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |

## Commands

Situations may arise where Plover will have to be explicitly told how to format a word. The following section goes over some useful formatting commands.

### Enter
#### Outline: `R-R`

### Enter (capitalize next word)
#### Outline: `R*R`

### Insert a space
#### Outline: `S-P`

Mnemonic: **sp**ace

Although Plover will automatically insert spaces before regular words, it may be necessary to manually insert a space so that two strokes should not be interpreted as a multistroke outline.


#### Example

* `KOR/TPHET` cornet
* `KOR/S-P/TPHET` core net

### Retroactively insert a space
#### Outline: `S-PD`

Mnemonic: the `S-P` outline but with `-D` to indicate that this is a retroactive command.

#### Example
* `KOR/TPHET` cornet
* `KOR/TPHET/S-PD` core net

> **NOTE:** this does not work with multistroke outlines if `S-PD` is pressed in between two strokes part of the same word. For example, the phrase "core nettle" **cannot** be written like `KOR/TPHET/S-PD/-L`.

### Suppress the next space
#### Outline: `SP-S`

Mnemonic: **s**u**pp**ress **s**pace

#### Example
* how ever `HOU/-FR`
* however `HOU/SP-S/-FR`

### Retroactively suppress the last space
#### Outline: `SP-LS`

Mnemonic: **s**u**pp**ress **l**ast **s**pace

#### Example
* `PHOR/AUFR` more over
* `PHOR/AUFR/SP-LS` moreover

### Capitalize the next word
#### Outline: `KPA`

Mnemonic: the word "cap" but with the "a" and "p" out of order

#### Example
* `-T/KPA/AOEU/HRAPBD` the Island

### Retroactively capitalize the next word
#### Outline: `KA*PD`

Mnemonic: the word "capped" but with the asterisk

#### Example
* `-T/AOEU/HRAPBD/KA*PD` the Island

### Capitalize the next word and suppress the next space
#### Outline: `KPA*`

Mnemonic: the `KPA` outline with the asterisk

This is useful for starting a new sentence.

### Uncapitalize the next word
#### Outline: `HRO*ER`

Mnemonic: the word "lower" but with the asterisk

### Retroactively uncapitalize the next word
#### Outline: `HRO*ERD`

Mnemonic: the `HRO*ER` outline but with `-D` to indicate the retro command.
