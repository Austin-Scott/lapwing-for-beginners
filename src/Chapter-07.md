## Intro

Vowels are reportedly the most difficult part of learning steno. Part of this is due to the fact that vowels are pronounced differently in different dialects of English. Unfortunately, I grew up learning General American English. This is the accent that Lapwing is based on.

> If you speak a different accent, you may have to subvocalize with an American accent (sorry).

I'm making an effort to include IPA with the hopes that they will be useful for some. However, I must make the disclaimer that I have never taken a formal linguistics course nor am I an enthusiast. I apologize for any errors that may be present in this page—do reach out to me if you have corrections!

## `OE`, `OU`, and `OEU`

* `OE` is the *long o* vowel as in "t<ins>o</ins>te"
   - /oʊ/
   
<steno-outline stroke="OE" width="100%" alt="OE on the steno layout"></steno-outline>

> Linguistically, calling this a *long vowel* is incorrect (this is actually a diphthong), but it's what most people would be familiar with ([see here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_length#%22Long%22_and_%22short%22_vowel_letters_in_spelling_and_the_classroom_teaching_of_reading)).

* `OU` is the "ow" sound as in "c<ins>ow</ins>"
   - /aʊ/

<steno-outline stroke="OU" width="100%" alt="OU on the steno layout"></steno-outline>

* `OUR` is the sound as in "h<ins>our</ins>"
   - /aʊ ər/

<steno-outline stroke="OUR" width="100%" alt="OUR on the steno layout"></steno-outline>

* `OEU` is the sound as in "t<ins>oy</ins>"
  - /ɔɪ/

<steno-outline stroke="OEU" width="100%" alt="OEU on the steno layout"></steno-outline>

### Examples

* foe `TPOE`\*
* sow `SOE`
* foul `TPOUL`\*
* power `POUR`
* coil `KOEUL`
* soy `SOEU`

> If you're having trouble associating the `OE` and `OU` chords, I suggest remembering the words marked with \*.

### Mnemonics

1. The word "foe" is spelled with the letters `OE`.
    - Apply this to other words with the same vowel sound!
2. The word "our" is spelled with `OU`.
3. `OEU` can be thought of as `O` + `EU` or "oi" which resembles its pronunciation and spelling (as in the word "s**oi**l")

## `AEU`

<steno-outline stroke="AEU" width="100%" alt="AEU on the steno layout"></steno-outline>

* `AEU` is the *long a* vowel as in "p<ins>ay</ins>"
   - /eɪ/

> **NOTE:** be careful with words like "bag", "tank", and "sag"; these use `A` for /æ/ and **not** `AEU`. The difference is subtle, but try to convince yourself that these are different vowels.

* `AEUR` is the sound as in "p<ins>air</ins>"
   - /ɛr/

### Mnemonics

> Feel free to come up with your own or even suggest some!

1. `AEU` can be thought as `A` + `EU` or "ai" which resembles its pronunciation and spelling (as in the word "p<ins>ai</ins>d")
2. If the notion of *long vowels* and *short vowels* (as described above) is familiar, `AEU` can be thought of as transforming the `A` key into a *long a* by combining it with the two keys on the other side
    - *Long a* = `A`  + (vowel keys on other hand)

## `AOU`

<steno-outline stroke="AOU" width="100%" alt="AOU on the steno layout"></steno-outline>

* `AOU` represents two different sounds:
   1. The *long u* sound as in "c<ins>u</ins>be"
      - /ju/
   2. The "oo" sound as in "gl<ins>u</ins>e"
      - /u/
      - **Only when the sound is not spelled with "oo"**
        - E.g., "loo" would **not** use `AOU`

* `AOUR` is the sound as in "c**ur**e"
  - /ʊər/

### Mnemonics

> Feel free to come up with your own or even suggest some!

1. If the notion of *long vowels* and *short vowels* (as described above) is familiar, the `AOU` chord can be thought of as transforming the `U` key into a *long u* by combining it with the two keys on the other side
    - *Long u* = `U` + (vowel keys on other hand)
2. The *long u* sound is also quite similar to the "oo" sound

## Chapter briefs

> This section is completely optional, but recommended. If you prefer to learn these all at once, they will be covered in chapter 16.

| Word | Brief | Explanation |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| a | `AEU` | Sounds like the letter "A" |
| can | `K` | Single key brief for a common word |
| for | `TP-R` | Drops the vowel |
| in | `TPH` | i<ins>n</ins> |
| if | `TP` | i<ins>f</ins> |
| new | `TPHU` | The proper *long u* `TPHAOU` vowel is reserved for the word "knew" |
| to | `TO` | Matches the spelling |
| two | `TWO` | Matches the spelling |
| , | `KW-BG` | Symmetrical shape like the period/full stop. |
| ! | `TP-BG` | Shape resembles a lowering intonation (not accurate to the exclamation mark, but contrasts with the question mark). |
