## Intro

Vowels are reportedly the most difficult part of learning steno. Part of this is due to the fact that vowels are pronounced differently in different dialects of English. Unfortunately, I grew up learning General American English. This is the accent that Lapwing is based on. If you speak a different accent, you may have to subvocalize with an American accent.

I'm making an effort to include IPA with the hopes that they will be useful for some. However, I must make the disclaimer that I have never taken a formal linguistics course nor am I an enthusiast. I apologize for any errors that may be present in this page—do reach out to me if you have corrections!

## `OE`, `OU`, and `OEU`

![oe ou and oeu](img/7-oe-ou-and-oeu.png)

* `OE` is the "long o" vowel as in "t<ins>o</ins>te"
   - /oʊ/

> Linguistically, calling this a "long vowel" is incorrect (this is actually a diphthong), but it's what most people would be familiar with ([see here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_length#%22Long%22_and_%22short%22_vowel_letters_in_spelling_and_the_classroom_teaching_of_reading)).

* `OU` is the "ow" sound as in "c<ins>ow</ins>"
   - /aʊ/
* `OUR` is the sound as in "h<ins>our</ins>"
   - /aʊ ər/

* `OEU` is the sound as in "t<ins>oy</ins>"
  - /ɔɪ/

### Mnemonics

> Feel free to come up with your own or even suggest some!

1. The word "foe" uses `OE` which you can tell from its spelling
    - Apply this to other words with the same vowel sound!
2. The word "our" uses `OU` which, again, you can tell from its spelling
3. You can think of `OEU` as `O` + `EU` or "oi" which resembles its pronunciation and spelling (as in the word "s**oi**l")

## `AEU`

![aeu](img/7-aeu.png)

* `AEU` is the "long a" vowel as in "p<ins>ay</ins>"
   - /eɪ/

> **NOTE:** be careful with words like "bag", "tank", and "sag"; these use `A` for /æ/ and **not** `AEU`. The difference is subtle, but try to convince yourself that these are different vowels.

* `AEUR` is the sound as in "p<ins>air</ins>"
   - /ɛr/

### Mnemonics

> Feel free to come up with your own or even suggest some!

1. You can think of `AEU` as `A` + `EU` or "ai" which resembles its pronunciation and spelling (as in the word "p<ins>ai</ins>d")
2. If the notion of "long" and "short" vowels (as described above) is familiar, you can think of transforming the `A` key into a "long a" by combining it with the two keys on the other side
    - "Long a" = `A`  + (vowel keys on other hand)

## `AOU`

![aou](img/7-aou.png)

* `AOU` represents two different sounds:
   1. The "long u" sound as in "c<ins>u</ins>be"
      - /ju/
   2. The "long oo" sound as in "gl<ins>u</ins>e"
      - /u/
      - **Only when the sound is not spelled with "oo"**
        - E.g., "loo" would **not** use `AOU`

* `AOUR` is the sound as in "c**ur**e"
  - /ʊər/

1. If the notion of "long" and "short" vowels (as described above) is familiar, you can think of transforming the `U` key into a "long u" by combining it with the two keys on the other side
    - "Long u" = `U` + (vowel keys on other hand)
2. The "long u" sound is also quite similar to the "long oo" sound
