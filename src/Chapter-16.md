## Introduction

In English, the 200 most frequently used words account for something like 80% of all writing. Because of this, these words tend to be written with abbreviated outlines heavily for speed and comfort. About 50 of the 200 most common English words need to be memorized; they cannot always be written with theory principles covered so far. It's important to be comfortable writing all of these words by the end of this chapter.

### Write-outs versus briefs

A *write-out* refers to an outline that adheres to theory principles very closely. They are the canonical outline to use when in doubt. On the other hand, a *brief* is an outline that doesn't necessarily follow theory. It is an abbreviated entry that is used for greater speed.

Some words do not have a write-out entry and will only have a brief which needs to be memorized. On the other hand, some words may only have a write-out. Finally, some may also have a brief and a write-out. If no explanation is provided, you may use either one.

> **NOTE:** you may find other briefs in the dictionary that are not mentioned in this page. I recommend not using them until you are done theory and are comfortable with your dictionary.

### How to complete this chapter
