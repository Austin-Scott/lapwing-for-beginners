# Chapter 21: Theory principles wrap-up

## Intro
This page serves as a reference for all the miscellaneous theory principles that only apply to a few words. It's not important to explicitly memorize the content on this page as you will likely encounter these situations in everyday writing.

When you do find odd entries via the lookup tool, first consult this page. If you cannot find an explanation, free to contact me on Discord (@aerbg). It may be that I have not yet documented the oddity here or that the entry itself may be incorrect.

## Acronyms

For capitalized acronyms, Lapwing treats these as regular words for the most part. Write the first stroke with the asterisk and the number key, but continue the rest of the acronym with regular theory rules, although, it is generally okay to break steno order. Usually writing an acronym involves spelling the letters it is made up of. For short acronyms, it can also be faster to fingerspell.

- AWOL `#A*EU/WOL`
- LAN `#HRA*PB`
- PDF `#P*FD`

## Contractions

Contractions are written with theory rules, but use the asterisk key.

Here are some common contractions.

| Contraction | Outline |
| ---- | ---- |
| he's | `HAO*ES` |
| he'll | `HAO*EL` |
| we're | `WAO*ER` |
| who's | `WHO*S` |

Some contractions that are based off of common words that are briefed in Lapwing are written a bit less intuitively:

| Contraction | Outline |
| ---- | ---- |
| what's | `WHA*S` |
| that's | `THA*S` |

## `-RB` for "-rb" vs "-sh"

Sometimes it can be ambiguous whether `-RB` represents "-rb" or "-sh" as in the following pair of words:

* cash
* carb

In these cases, "-sh" gets precedence and the word with "-rb" is instead asterisked.

## Disambiguating "ou" with `OU`

Plover's `main.json` uses `OU` for many words that are spelled with "ou" (especially when there is a conflict). For example, `KORS` would be the word "cores" and therefore "course" would have to be `KOURS`. Lapwing doesn't use this technique; it's preferred that you use `O` as much as possible and `OU` only when it's absolutely necessary.

These are the following such cases to memorize or at least note:

1. `TPOR` is already used so "four" is `TPOUR` or `TPO*R`.
2. `KWROUR` exists for "your" as a brief.
3. The word "tour" can only be written as `TAOUR` even if that is not how you pronounce it (myself included).
4. Similarly, the word "mourn" can only be written as `PHAOURPB`.
5. The word "soul" can be written `SO*EL` or `SOUL`.

## `W` for glides

For some words, using `W` for a glide might be closer phonetically:

* `EBG/WEU/TEU` equity
* `EBGS/TEUPBG/WEURB` extinguish
* `EUPB/TAOU/WEU/TEUF` intuitive
* `AOU/PWEUBG/WEU/TEU` ubiquity

## "-graph" words

### "-graph"

Write the first part as if it is its own standalone word and then use `TKPWRAF` to write the "-graph" part separately:

* `AU/TOE/TKPWRAF` autograph
* `PAEUR/KWRA/TKPWRAF` paragraph
* `PHEUPL/KWROE/TKPWRAF` mimeograph
* `TE/HRE/TKPWRAF` telegraph

### "-graphy"

Write the "-graph" part separately and then use the `KWREU` suffix to add the "-y":

* `SKWRAOE/KWRO/TKPWRAF/KWREU` geography
* `OR/THO/TKPWRAF/KWREU` orthography
* `STE/TPHO/TKPWRAF/KWREU` stenography
* `SREUD/KWRO/TKPWRAF/KWREU` videography

### Alternative "-graphy" outline

Instead of `TKPWRAF/KWREU`, you can also use `TKPWRAEF`:

* `SKWRAOE/KWRO/TKPWRAEF` geography
* `OR/THO/TKPWRAEF` orthography
* `STE/TPHO/TKPWRAEF` stenography
* `SREUD/KWRO/TKPWRAEF` videography

This uses a briefing technique called "E-folding" where the `E` key represents another vowel and is "tucked" into a steno stroke. In this case, the `E` represents the "long e" sound. Often, this extra sound is phonetically at the end of the word. This is an example of when steno order can be violated in briefs.

E-folding is covered further in [chapter 24](Chapter-24.md#e-folding)

### "-grapher"

Write the "-graph" part separately and then use the `*ER` suffix to add the "-er":

* `KAR/TO/TKPWRAF/*ER` cartographer
* `KHOR/KWRO/TKPWRAF/*ER` choreographer
* `HREBG/SEU/KO/TKPWRAF/*ER` lexicographer
* `OEGS/KWRO/TKPWRAF/*ER` oceanographer

### Alternative "-grapher" outline

Instead of `TKPWRAF/*ER`, you can also use `TKPWRAFR`:

* `KAR/TO/TKPWRAFR` cartographer
* `KHOR/KWRO/TKPWRAFR` choreographer
* `HREBG/SEU/KO/TKPWRAFR` lexicographer
* `OEGS/KWRO/TKPWRAFR` oceanographer

This uses a briefing technique where `-FR` can represent the "fer" sound.

### "-graphic"

Write the "-graph" part separately and then use the `KWREUBG` suffix to add the "-ic":

* `*ET/TPHOE/TKPWRAF/KWREUBG` ethnographic
* `HO/HRO/TKPWRA*F/KWREUBG` holographic
* `EUPB/TPOE/TKPWRAF/KWREUBG` infographic
* `PEUBG/TO/TKPWRAF/KWREUBG` pictographic

### Alternative "-graphic" outline

Instead of `TKPWRAF/KWREUBG`, you can also use `TKPWRAFBG`:

* `*ET/TPHOE/TKPWRAFBG` ethnographic
* `HO/HRO/TKPWRAFBG` holographic
* `EUPB/TPOE/TKPWRAFBG` infographic
* `PEUBG/TO/TKPWRAFBG` pictographic

This uses a briefing technique where you drop unstressed vowels such as the "i" in graph**i**c.

## "-ology" words
These are written using regular syllabic splitting:

* `ARBG/KWRO/HRO/SKWREU` archaeology
* `A/STRO/HRO/SKWREU` astrology
* `AOE/KO/HRO/SKWREU` ecology
* `OR/TPHEU/THO/HRO/SKWREU` ornithology

### Alternative "-ology" chord

Instead of writing the `O/HRO/SKWREU` cluster, you can instead use the `OLG` chord.

* `ARBG/KWROLG` archaeology
* `A/STROLG` astrology
* `AOE/KOLG` ecology
* `OR/TPHEU/THOLG` ornithology

This is simply just a briefing pattern. These outlines are much shorter than the write-outs and are highly recommended.

## Ambiguous glide vowels

In some words containing glides represented with `KWR` or `W`, the proceeding vowel sound is spelled with two letters. The sound itself is an unstressed schwa (a "short vowel"), and so the **second** vowel letter is what determines which key to use.

Here are some examples to illustrate:

* `KAF/KWRAT` cave**a**t
* `KORPB/KWRAL` corne**a**l
* `HRAOEPB/KWREPBS` leni**e**nce
* `PHA/TREU/HREUPB/KWRAL` matriline**a**l

Another way of thinking about this is that the `KWR` or the `W` glide represents the first vowel letter and the second vowel letter is represented by the vowel key in the steno stroke.

## "-ual" words

If you were to split these words using regular syllabic splitting, it would be difficult to accurately reflect the glide in the "-ual" sound. For example, if you were write the word "manual" in a way that the second stroke begins with a consonant, you would be left with `PHA/TPHAOU`. You could add a last stroke `WAL` to complete the word, but three strokes for such a short word is not very fast indeed. Instead, we can use `WAL` to represent the entire "-ual" cluster. This allows us to include the "n" consonant in the first stroke: `PHAPB/WAL`.

### `WAL`

You can also think of the `WAL` stroke orthographically: the `W` key represents the "u", and the `AL` represents the "al".

* `AOEBG/WAL` equal
* `HA/PWEUFP/WAL` habitual
* `PER/PEFP/WAL` perpetual
* `AOURB/WAL` usual

It can also be used like a suffix:

* `KOPB/TRABGT/WAL` contractual
* `KOPB/TEGT/WAL` contextual
* `HA/PWEUT/WAL` habitual
* `SEBGS/WAL` sexual

### `TWAL`

You can also use `TWAL` as the "chwal" cluster like in the following words:

* `TPABG/TWAL` factual
* `HA/PWEU/TWAL` habitual
* `EUPB/TE/HREBG/TWAL` intellectual
* `SREUR/TWAL` virtual

I prefer using `TWAL` over `WAL` (when possible) as it more closely resembles the pronunciation it is supposed to represent.

### `KWRAOUL`

You are also free to come up with your own strokes for dealing with these words. In hindsight, `KWRAOUL` would be a better fit to some of these words, however, as I am already accustomed to `WAL`, I am not about to change these around. Furthermore, if `PHA/TPHAOU/WAL` or `PHA/TPHAOUL` do, in fact, make more sense to you, you should absolutely make changes to your dictionary.

## "Improperly" used suffix strokes

Sometimes, you may want to use a stroke that resembles a suffix stroke but isn't actually defined in the way that you intend to use it. For example, the word "hyphenate" is clearly related to "hyphen" and, therefore, it might make more sense to use a suffix rather than `HAOEU/TP*E/TPHAEUT`. While `KWRAEUT` is defined as `{^iate}`, it is acceptable to use this suffix stroke in this situation: `HAOEU/TP*EPB/KWRAEUT`.

## Doubling consonants with prefixes

With prefix strokes, you are allowed to double consonants between two strokes if it makes sense to do so. This is entirely up to your discretion. Here are some examples you can find in the default Lapwing dictionary:

- `EUPL/PHOE/PWAOEUL` immobile
   - `EUPL` is the "im-" prefix
- need more examples

There can also be alternative strokes that exist in the dictionary (for example, `EUPL/KWROE/PWAOEUL`). Use whichever makes the most sense to you, or add your own!

## Splitting a sound at "ng"

If you have to split a word into multiple syllables at "ng", use `...PBG/TKPW...`

If you feel uncomfortable that this is doubling a consonant between two strokes, feel free to use any of the alternatives:

1. `...PB/TKPW...`
2. `...PBG/KWR...`

### Examples

* bingo `PWEUPBG/TKPWOE` or `PWEUPB/TKPWOE` or `PWEUPBG/KWROE`
* tango `TAPBG/TKPWOE` or `TAPB/TKPWOE` or `TAPBG/KWROE`


## Prefix outline conflicts

### Single stroke briefed prefixes

Here are once again the tables from chapter 12 and 15:

| Prefix/word | Prefix Outline | Recommended word outline(s) | Explanation |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| a | `A` | `AEU` | `A*` is already used. |
| bi^ (by) | `PWAOEU` | `PWEU` | There is a three way conflict between "by", "bye", and "buy". |
| be | `PWE` | `-B` | Useful in phrase briefs. |
| for | `TPOR` | `TP-R` or `TPAURT` | Useful in phrases like "for the" `TP-RT`. |
| in | `EUPB` | `TPH` | Useful in phrases like "in the" `TPH-T`. |
| or | `OR` | `AOUR` or `AUR` | `O*R` is already used (see below). |
| out | `OUT` | `O*UT` or `AOUT` | Either works (see below). |
| on | `OPB` | `O*PB` or `AUPB` | Either works (see below). |
| tri^ (try) | `TRAOEU` | `TRAO*EU` or `TREU` | The first is the more "formal" outline, but the second matches the pattern with "by". |

#### Three way conflict between "by", "bye", and "buy":

| Word | Outline |
| ---- | ---- |
| by | `PWEU` |
| bye | `PW*EU` |
| buy | `PWAO*EU` |

Again, feel free to change around these outlines.

### Generic way of dealing with multisyllable prefix outlines

Press the asterisk in the last stroke of a multisyllable outline to get the word variant.

| Prefix/word | Prefix Outline | Word Outline |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| auto | `AU/TOE` | `AU/TO*E` |
| intro | `EUPB/TROE` | `EUPB/TRO*E` |
| over | `OE/SRER` | `OE/SR*ER` |
| under | `UPB/TKER` | `UPB/TK*ER` |

Some of these can also be briefed. Feel free to use the look up and discover briefs.

### Special conflicts

Another technique for disambiguating between prefixes and words is using alternative vowels. One common case is using `AU` instead of `OE` and `O`. This is sometimes recommended over using the asterisk key as it is much easier to press:

| Prefix/word | Prefix Outline | Word outline |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| on | `OPB` | `AUPB` |
| or | `OR` | `AUR` |
| over | `OEFR` | `AUFR` |
| off |`OF` | `AUF` |

### Prefix strokes vs compound words

Sometimes it can be arbitrary to determine whether you should write a word as a compound word rather than a word with a prefix. For example, the Lapwing dictionary by default treats words like "upright" and "downwards" as compound words as you can only write these as `UP/RAO*EUT` and `TKOUPB/WA*RD/-Z`. In these cases, it is perfectly reasonable to edit your dictionary and add prefix strokes that make sense to you.

## Problematic words

This table contains words that don't quite follow main theory principles.

| Word | Recommended outline | Explanation |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| cache | `KAERB` | `KARB` and `KA*RB` are both already used as "cash" and "carb" so the `E` key is used to disambiguate. |
| fore | `TPOER` | `TPOR` and `TPO*R` are already used so we use the `E` as a disambiguation key. |
| herein | `HAOER/KWREUPB` or `HAOERPB` | It's not recommended to treat this as a compound word as it would use a fingerspelling stroke: `HAOER/TPH*`.
| hi | `HEU` | `HAOEU` is the word "high" already. |
| hour | `HOUR` | `OUR` is already used so the `H` key is added even though it is silent. |
| lunch | `HRUFRPBLG` | `HRUFRPB` is already used so `-LG` is used as a disambiguation chord. This is recommended over `HR*UFRPB` as it is slightly easier to press.|
| nought | `TPHA*UT` | `TPHAUT`, `TPHOT`, and `TPHO*T` are already used. |
| poll/pole | `POL`/`POEL` | No real reason. Feel free to change things around and/or use the asterisk key for disambiguation. |
| scene | `SKAOEPB` | `SAOEPB` is already the word "seen" so "scene" is written with the `K` to disambiguate. |
| wolf | `WOEFL` or `WOFL` | While you could write this as `WOEL/*F` or `WOL/*F`, it's just much faster to learn one of these briefs. |
| werewolf | lots of outlines | You can use `WAEUR` or `WER` for the first stroke. However, if you use `WER`, you will have to to asterisk the second word since there is a potential conflict between the phrase "were wolves" and the word "werewolves". |
