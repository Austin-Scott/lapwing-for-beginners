## Intro

Vowels are reportedly the most difficult part of learning steno. Part of this is due to the fact that vowels are pronounced differently in different dialects of English. Unfortunately, I grew up learning General American English. This is the accent that Lapwing is based on. If you speak a different accent, you may have to subvocalize with an American accent.

I'm making an effort to include IPA with the hopes that they will be useful for some. However, I must make the disclaimer that I have never taken a formal linguistics course nor am I an enthusiast. I apologize for any errors that may be present in this page—do reach out to me if you have corrections!

### What is a conflict?

Throughout this page, you will see the word "conflict" thrown around a lot. Since steno is a primarily phonetic system, we will sometimes encounter pairs of words which would be written exactly the same. For example, we learned that `AEUR` represents the sound in "p<ins>air</ins>". However, this is also the same sound in the word "p<ins>ear</ins>". We would call this an example of a "conflict" (these two words conflict with the same outline). As you'll see, we usually resolve these conflicts by using different chords based on spellings.

## `AOE`

![aoe](img/8-aoe.png)

* `AOE` is the "long e" sound as in "b<ins>ee</ins>t"
  - /i/
* `AOER` is the sound as in "p<ins>eer</ins>"
  - /ɪər/

* teal `TAOEL`

### Mnemonics

> Feel free to come up with your own or even suggest some!

1. If the notion of "long" and "short" vowels (as described in the previous chapter) is familiar, you can think of transforming the `E` key into a "long e" by combining it with the two keys on the other side
    - "Long e" = `E` + (vowel keys on other hand)

### Section practice

## `AOEU`

![aoeu](img/8-aoeu.png)

* `AOEU` is the "long i" sound as in "<ins>i</ins>ce"
  - /aɪ/
* `AOEUR` is the sound as in "<ins>ir</ins>e"
  - /aɪər/

### Mnemonics

> Feel free to come up with your own or even suggest some!

1. If the notion of "long" and "short" vowels (as described in the previous chapter) is familiar, you can think of transforming the "i" chord into a "long i" by combining it with the two keys on the other side
    - "Long i" = `EU` + (vowel keys on other hand)

### Section practice

## `AU`

![au](img/8-au.png)

We learned the following in chapter 5 (rule 2 of short vowels):

> If a word is spelled using multiple vowel letters that (together) are pronounced as a single short vowel, use the vowel key that corresponds to the sound.

The `AU` chord is one exception to this rule. It is used in words like "bought", and "caught". These have the same sound as the `O` key by itself. However, `AU` is used in these words as they are **not spelled** with a single "o".

So while the following are written using `O`:

* bot `PWOT`
* cot `KOT`

The words below are written using `AU`:

* bought `PWAUT`
* caught `KAUT`

### Minor conflicts

Words spelled with "au" are given `A*UL` when there is a conflict:

* call `KAUL`
* caul `KA*UL`
* hall `HAUL`
* haul `HA*UL`

Words spelled with "awl" are also given `A*UL` when there is a conflict:

* all `AUL`
* awl `A*UL`
* ball `PWAUL`
* bawl `PWA*UL`

These words will not be tested as there are so few of them; it would be pointless to drill these minor conflicts as you would be likely to forget about them in everyday writing. However, this conflict resolution technique is still useful to keep in mind.

## `AE` for `AEU`

![ae](img/8-ae.png)

Take a look at the following words:

* pair
* pear

We can't assign the outline `PAEUR` to both of these words, so we will need a different vowel chord to differentiate the two. This is where `AE` comes into play. It is a secondary chord that can represent the same vowel as `AEU` when there is conflict.

In these conflicts involving the "long a" sound, one word will use `AEU`. This is the word with higher priority. The other word will use `AE`; this is the word with lower priority. We use spellings to determine the priority to assign to a word.

### Highest priority: "ai" or "ei" spellings

Words spelled with "ai" or "ei" get the highest priority, and are always written using `AEU`:

* `AEUT` eight
* `TPAEUR` fair
* `PHAEUPB` main
* `PAEUR` pair

### Medium priority: "a_e" spellings

These words get medium priority. Use `AE` for these words if there is a conflict with a word in the above category.

* `AET` ate (`AEUT` is already "eight")
* `TPAER` fare (`TPAEUR` is already "fair")
* `TAEUR` tare ("tair" is not a word)
* `PHAEPB` mane (`PHAEUPB` is already "main")

### Lowest priority: "ea" spellings

These words get lowest priority. If there is a conflict with any of the two categories above, use `AE`.

* `TAER` tear (`TAEUR` is already "tare")
* `PAER` pear (`PAEUR` is already "pair")
* `SWAEUR` swear ("swair" and "sware" are not words)

Remember that `AE` is **only used to disambiguate**. Try not to associate this chord with any specific spelling or sound.

### Flowchart Summary

Here's a flowchart to summarize the above:

![aeur flowchart](img/8-aeu-flowchart.png)

## `AE` for `AOE`

In addition to the `AEU` vowel, `AE` can also represent the `AOE` vowel when there is ambiguity. Again, we assign certain spellings to higher priority and use `AE` for lower priority spellings when there are homonyms.

### Highest priority: "ee" spellings

All words spelled with "ee" use `AOE`

* `TPAOET` feet
* `PAOE` pee
* `SAOED` seed
* `TAOE` tee

### Medium priority: "ie" spellings

* `PAOES` piece

### Lowest priority: "ea" spellings

* `TPAET` feat (`TPAOET` is already "feet")
* `PAE` pea (`PAOE` is already "pee")

### Flowchart Summary

Here's a flowchart to summarize the above:

![](img/8-aoe-flowchart.png)

## Other uses of `AE` for disambiguating

`AE` can also be used for "ea" spellings that conflict with short vowels.

* lead `HRAED` (`HRED` is already "led")
* bread `PWRAED` (`PWRED` is already "bred")

## `AE` 3-way conflicts

You may wonder about, or even encounter a few 3-way conflicts. For example, "pair", "pare", and "pear". There really aren't that many of these so Lapwing doesn't actually provide any rules on how to deal with these.

By default the Lapwing dictionary assigns `PAER` to "pear" and `PA*EUR` to "pare". The reason for this is that "pear" is much more common and is considered higher priority than "pare". You are, of course, free to disagree with this logic and change things around! It is really up to you how you want to deal with these conflicts.

> **NOTE:** considering priority based on how common words are is generally used as a last resort where the rules are fuzzy or nonexistent (like in this example). You will not see this in any concrete Lapwing rules.

## `AO`

![](img/8-ao.png)

This chord has two uses:

1. Words spelled with "oo", regardless of their pronunciation
   - wood `WAOD`
   - hood `HAOD`
   - blood `PWHRAOD`
   - tool `TAOL`
2. Words spelled with "oa" when there is a conflict
   - oar `AOR` (`OR` is already "or")
   - soar `SAOR` (`SOR` is already "sore")
   - boar `PWAOR` (`PWOR` is already "bore")
   - road `RAOD` (`ROED` is already "rode")

> **NOTE:** you may be tempted to write "boat" as `PWAOT`, but this is incorrect. `AO` is primarily used for "oo" spellings. Therefore, `PWAOT` is actually the word "boot"; `PWOET` would be "boat".
