## Lapwing setup
So far, we have just been using Plover without any modifications. As this series is about learning Lapwing theory, it's important that we set up Plover correctly. There are two options: you can install the <code class="code-mono">plover-lapwing-aio</code> plugin or you can add the Lapwing dictionaries manually. If you are a beginner, use the all-in-one plugin discussed below.

### Using the all-in-one plugin

In Plover's main window, click on <code class="code-mono">Tools → Plugins Manager</code>. Scroll down until you see <code class="code-mono">plover-lapwing-aio</code> and select it. Press <code class="code-mono">Install/Update</code> and make sure to press the <code class="code-mono">Restart</code> button afterwards.

![plugins manager](img/5-plugins-manager.png)

> **NOTE:** just closing the main window is not sufficient to restart Plover. **You will have to press the restart button or manually quit Plover by going to <code class="code-mono">File → Quit Plover</code> and opening Plover again.**

Once Plover has been restarted, in Plover's main window, click on <code class="code-mono">Configure → System</code> and change the system to <code class="code-mono">Lapwing</code>. Press <code class="code-mono">Apply</code> and <code class="code-mono">OK</code>—you should now be good to go!

If you'd like to know more about the default dictionaries that come with the all-in-one plugin, have a look at the [homepage](https://github.com/aerickt/plover-lapwing-aio).

### Setting up Lapwing manually

If you do not want to use the all-in-one plugin, please see [Appendix B](Appendix-B.md) if you wish to set up Lapwing dictionaries manually (not recommended).

## Typey Type

We will now use Typey Type for drilling. The benefit of Typey Type is that you can upload custom lessons with their own custom outlines.

### [Click here to access Typey Type shown above](https://didoesdigital.com/typey-type/lessons/custom/setup)

Lessons in this series will be provided as links to text files. Left clicking on these links will display the contents of each lesson. Copy and paste the entire file (<code class="code-mono">Ctrl + A</code> or <code class="code-mono">Cmd + A</code>  to select the whole page) into the text box above. After that, press "Start custom lesson".

**Make sure to sort the words randomly on the right hand side.**

You may tweak additional settings to your liking, but the defaults are perfectly fine.

If you would like to try this out, here is one example of a lesson:

## Basic phonetics—single syllable words

In the previous chapter's test, you had to write all the different combinations of strokes that involve a left hand consonant, a vowel, and a right hand consonant. You may have noticed that some of these strokes actually resemble words like `POT`, `TAP`, and `HUT`. In Lapwing theory, this is exactly how you would write the words "pot", "tap", and "hut", respectively.

The reason for this is:

**Every key represents the sound it is labelled with (unless it is part of a chord).**

> This means that the `P` in `POT` represents the "p" sound. However, the `P` in `TPAUT` does not represent the "p" sound since it is part of the `TP` chord. Do not worry about identifying chords for now.

Thus, here are some examples of some basic words you can write just by knowing the layout:

* cat `KAT`
* rub `RUB`
* purr `PUR`
* rough `RUF`

Those last two words may have been a little bit tricky as they are spelled using multiple vowel letters. Here are some rules for dealing with short vowels:

1. **If a word is spelled using a single vowel, simply use the vowel key that spells the word.**

2. **If a word is spelled using multiple vowel letters that (together) are pronounced as a single short vowel, use the vowel key that corresponds to the sound.**

### Different vowels with `-R`?

The words "purr" and "rub" have phonetically different vowels and yet still use the same vowel keys.

This is not limited to the `U` vowel; for example, we see this in:

* `AR` as in "c<ins>ar</ins>"
* `OR` as in "t<ins>or</ins>e"
* `ER` as in "p<ins>er</ins>"
* `UR` as in "p<ins>urr</ins>"

Remember that with short vowels, we care more about their spelling and not so much about how they are pronounced (rule 1 above). We essentially treat the `-R` as a consonant even though its inclusion with a vowel key subtly changes the sound.

## Steno order

Looking at the steno layout, why is it that you *must* write the word "car" using the left `K`, and the right hand `-R`?

![](img/1-layout.png)

The answer is **steno order**.

![](img/5-order.png)

Sounds you make on the layout are supposed to follow this order.

**#STKPWHRAO\*EUFRPBLGTSDZ**

Therefore, the only correct way to write the word "car" would be  `KAR`.

**#ST<ins>K</ins>PWHR<ins>A</ins>O\*EUF<ins>R</ins>PBLGTSDZ**

The following is not how you write `KAR`; it is actually `KRA`:

![KRA](img/5-kra.png)

While you don't have to memorize steno order explicitly, you should be able to break sounds into steno strokes that follow steno order. This may sound difficult, but with time and practice this will come quite naturally.

### Impossible single syllable words

Here are some examples of single syllable words that you cannot write in one stroke as the sounds do not fall in steno order.

* trust
   - Closest would be `TRUTS`
   - #S<ins>T</ins>KPWH<ins>R</ins>AO*E<ins>U</ins>PBLG<ins>TS</ins>DZ
* turf
   - Closest would be `TUFR`
   - #S<ins>T</ins>KPWHRAO*E<ins>UFR</ins>PBLGTSDZ

Try to convince yourself that you cannot write these words in one stroke, despite the fact that all the sounds can be found on the layout. Do not worry about how to actually write these words right now—you will later learn theory that covers these situations.

## Combining single left hand keys

Before even learning some of the more complicated chords, there are some sounds on the left hand that can be combined together quite intuitively.

* `ST` as in "<ins>st</ins>op"
* `SK` as in "<ins>sc</ins>ar"
* `SP` as in "<ins>sp</ins>ot"
* `SH` as in "<ins>sh</ins>op"
* `TH` as in "<ins>th</ins>ug"
* `TR` as in "<ins>tr</ins>ap"
* `KH` as in "<ins>ch</ins>ug"
* `KR` as in "<ins>cr</ins>op"
* `PR` as in "<ins>pr</ins>at"

> `KH` for "ch" might not be immediately obvious, but just remember that `K` is used for the "hard c" sound. Thus, if you accept that `K` can represent the letter "c", then combining it with the `H` key makes some sense.

### Section practice

[Basic left hand single syllable words](practice/5-single-syllable-basic-left-hand.txt)

## The missing short vowel

There are 5 short vowels, and you may have noticed that there is no "I" key. It's instead chorded with `EU`.

![](img/5-eu.png)

### Examples

* pit `PEUT`
* kill `KEUL`
* fit `TPEUT`
* lip `HREUP`
* fir `TPEUR`

> Again, with `TPEUR`, the addition of the `-R` key changes the vowel subtly, but that is accepted within our short vowel rules.

### Section practice
[Single syllable words with `EU`](practice/5-single-syllable-EU.txt)

## Left hand d, b, and l

* `TK` is "d" as in "<ins>d</ins>ab"
* `PW` is "b" as in "<ins>b</ins>ot"
* `HR` is "l" as in "<ins>l</ins>et"

![](img/5-dbl.png)

### Examples

* dad `TKAD`
* bar `PWAR`
* lap `HRAP`
* bled `PWHRED`

### Mnemonics

> Feel free to come up with your own or even suggest some!

1. Each of these chords are simply two keys in a column
   * `TK` is pressed by the left hand ring finger
   * `PW` is pressed by the left hand middle finger
   * `HR` is pressed by the left hand index finger
2. Think "DBL"
   * <ins>d</ins>ou<ins>bl</ins>e (these are *double* keys)
     * From [Art of Chording](https://www.artofchording.com)
   * <ins>d</ins>eci<ins>b</ins>e<ins>l</ins>
   * <ins>d</ins>ata<ins>b</ins>ase <ins>l</ins>over
