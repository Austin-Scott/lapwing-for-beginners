## Recommended pace

**Recommended time to spend on this chapter: <1 day.**

1. Read [Miscellaneous orthographic chords](#miscellaneous-orthographic-chords) and complete the drill (**10 minutes**)

## Great job!

If you've been following the recommended pacing, you should now be anywhere from 3 to 7 weeks into your stenography journey! That is very impressive and you should be proud of your perseverance! With this kind of commitment, chances are you will continue to do well in later chapters.

## What we've learned so far

You should be pretty familiar with the steno layout and you should also understand how to write most single syllable wordsâ€”even if you're not very fast yet. We will finally wrap up single syllable words in this chapter before moving onto other topics.

## Miscellaneous orthographic chords

### Left hand chords

We've already learned a few orthographic chords like `AU` and `AO` whose usages depend on spelling rather than pronunciation. There are also a few left hand consonant chords that behave the same way.

* "ph" as in "<ins>ph</ins>ase" is written with `TP*`
* "wr" as in "<ins>wr</ins>ite" is written with `WR`
* "wh" as in "<ins>wh</ins>en" is written with `WH`

All of these except `TP*` are pretty intuitive as their steno keys match the spelling that they represent.

### `KR` for c in conflicts

When there is a conflict between a word that contains the "soft c" sound and another word that is spelled with an s, use `KR`.

#### Examples
* cent `KREPBT`
  - As `SEPBT` is already "sent"
* cite `KRAOEUT`
  - As `SAOEUT` is already "sight"

### `KH` for hard c spelled ch

Words spelled with "ch" can sometimes be homophones with words spelled with only a single "c". In these cases, we use `K` for the words spelled with a "c" and `KH` for words spelled with "ch".

`KH` can also be used in general for words spelled with "ch" but pronounced with a "hard c". For example, in the word "choreography", the initial consonant is a "hard c" so `K` would typically be used on the left hand. However, using `KH` is also a valid choice. This is helpful if your first instinct is to use the "ch" spelling to form the left hand consonant.

> **NOTE:** the dictionary is not complete when it comes to "ch" words pronounced with a "hard c" and written with `KH`. I would recommend sticking to `K` and only using `KH` when there is a conflict. However, you are completely free to add these if you wish.

#### Examples
* chord `KHORD`
   - `KORD` is already "cord"
* charisma `KHA/REUS/PHA`
   - `KA/REUS/PHA` is also valid

### `-S` for all s

Use `-S` for an ending "s" letter, regardless of if it is pronounced as a "z".

#### Examples
* fuse `TPAOUS`
* cruise `KRAOUS`

### Conflicts

You will inevitably run into some conflicts such as "race", "raise", "raze", and "raiz". `-S` is given to "race" since it has an "s" sound, but how do we deal with the rest? It's actually entirely up to you as to how you might want to proceed. Conflicts such as these are tricky because they don't appear very often; you're better off memorizing the exceptions than trying to learn rules to deal with them.

By default, Lapwing gives `-Z` to "raise" since it's quite common and is spelled with an "s" (thereby giving it higher priority, in a sense). To write "raze", you'd use an alternative vowel chord: `RAEZ`. Finally, for "raiz", you could use the asterisk key. Although, this word isn't even in the default dictionary. Thus, you'd write these words like so:

* "race" `RAEUS`
* "raise" `RAEUZ`
* "raze" `RAEZ`
* "raiz" `RA*EUZ`

This illustrates how messy the English language can be and how designing a theory to work around all of these conflicts without any arbitrary rules/briefs can be a difficult task. When you run into conflicts with more than three words in the future, do remember that (unless explicitly stated) it is perfectly acceptable (even expected!) to change around some outlines. It's best to create outlines that make sense to you instead of memorizing someone else's personal intuition.

### y sound without the letter y

If you encounter a word that has the "y" sound, only use `KWR*` if it is spelled with a "y". If it isn't spelled with a "y" don't use any left hand consonant chord.

#### Examples
* yes `KWR*ES`
* yep `KWR*EP`
* use `AOUS`
* usual `AOURB/WAL`
  - There aren't, unfortunately, a lot of single stroke words to demonstrate this

### Section practice

[Left hand single syllable orthographic chords drill](practice/12-left-orthographic-chords.txt)

**It's very recommended that you complete this drill.**

## The stroke separator

So far we have only been looking at single stroke words. We will soon look at words that require multiple strokes to be written. To notate these multistroke outlines, we use the slash character `/` to separate strokes.

For example, to write the outline `TPEUL/-PL`, you would press `TPEUL`, release all the keys, and then press `-PL`.

## When sounds can't follow steno order

Sometimes, it is impossible to write a single syllable word using in a single stroke (see the examples below). In these cases, write as much of the word as you can in a single stroke, and then complete the rest using the corresponding right hand key or chord that finishes the word. Note that some right chords are different to their canonical form when using this technique:

* To end a word with "-t", use `*T`
* To end a word with "-f" or "-v", use `*F`

There will be no practice material for this section, but do keep this technique in mind.

### Examples

* film `TPEUL/-PL`
* helm `HEL/-PL`
* help `HEL/-P`
* kelp `KEL/-P`
* list `HREUS/*T`
  - Also `HR*EUS` (recommended, see note below)
* thirst `THEURS/*T`
  - Also `TH*EURS` (recommended, see note below)
* sixth `SEUBGS/*T`
* elf `EL/*F`
* shelf `SHEL/*F`
* peddle `PED/-L`
* saddle `SAD/-L`

> **NOTE:** remember that `*S` can be used to represent the "-st" cluster when `-F` is not available. It is highly recommended you use `*S` instead of splitting these words into two strokes.

## Right hand xt

* `-GT` is "-xt" as in te<ins>xt</ins>

There are only a handful of words in English that end in "-xt" and only two that are one syllable long in the Lapwing dictionary. You can pretty much just memorize these as briefs.

### Examples

* text `TEGT`
* next `TPHEGT`
