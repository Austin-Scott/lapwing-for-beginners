* Removed note on unstressed vowels in chapter 11. It is not necessary and may confuse readers instead.
* Rephrased the `-BL` compound cluster as primarily one sound.
   * However, since `-BL` can be used after dropping any vowel (mostly unstressed vowels), the wording has been updated.
   * It now uses the concept that the `-BL` chord can be extended to represent a preceding vowel.
* Added `-BLT` as a compound cluster.
* Removed recommended pace as it is not a helpful guide due to the huge diversity in learning styles/speeds.
   * Clarified that the recommended passing goal is more intended for those unsure of when to move to the next chapter.
